At the risk of saying what others have said: given that there's a single
reset line and a single clock line controlling all of these channels and
given what I recall of how address demuxers work in chips, everything
indicates that this is a single hardware block/device.

So the way that this should be described in DT is:

	pwm@1e610000 {
		reg =3D <0x1e610000 0x100>;
		clocks =3D ...;
		resets =3D ...
	};

That'd be the most accurate representation of this hardware in DT. It is
then up to the driver to expose this in any way you see fit. For Linux
it may make sense to expose this as 16 PWM channels and 16 hardware
monitoring devices. Other operating systems using the same DT may choose
to expose this differently, depending on their frameworks, etc. A simple
operating system may not expose this as separate resources at all but
instead directly program individual registers from this block.

I'd also like to add that I think trying to split this up into multiple
drivers in Linux is a bit overkill. In my opinion, though I know not
everyone shares this view, it's perfectly fine for one driver to expose
multiple types of resources. There's plenty of use-cases across the
kernel where tightly coupled devices like this have a single driver that
registers with multiple subsystems. Going through MFD only because this
particular hardware doesn't split registers nicely along Linux subsystem
boundaries.

So FWIW, I'm fine carrying hwmon code in a PWM driver and I'm equally
fine if PWM code ends up in a hwmon driver (or any other subsystem
really) if that makes sense for a given hardware.
