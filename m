It applies: since your hardware can not do arbitrary patterns, you
need description of what kinds of patterns it can do.

But you should still use compatible format, so that pattern that is
valid for hw_pattern file is valid for pattern file, too, and produces
same result.

If you believe documentation implies something else, it may need to be
clarified.
