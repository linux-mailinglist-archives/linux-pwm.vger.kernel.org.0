I read the i.MX25 PWM chapter a few times now, and I played around a
bit. I could confirm the issue.

This changes semantic, from "wait for at least one free FIFO slot" to
"wait for at least two FIFO slots". Maybe a comment would be good? At
least the comment above the caller of pwm_imx27_wait_fifo_slot() needs
adaption.

Also I wonder: If there is only a single free slot, there is no problem,
is there?

The error test is wrong then. If fifoav was initially 4 and waiting only
reduced it to 3, you don't trigger a warning.

On a side note: pwm_get_period() might return a value that is too big.
This could be improved using readl_poll_timeout.

	When the SAR FIFO is empty, a new SAR value will be applied directly
	instead of waiting for the current period to complete.

is grammatically better (at least with my German sense for English
grammar) and might be better to understand.

This can be expressed a bit easier (and more correct) I think:=20

	If the SAR value is decreased over the counter value, there is
	no compare event in the current period resulting in a 100%
	period.

(This is more correct because decreasing the SAR from 200 to 100 if the
counter is already at 300 doesn't result in the problem.)

The usual term is "turn off interrupts" because not only the PWM irq is
disabled, but all are. I wonder if just disabling irqs serves the same
purpose.

Disabling interrupts is never good for real-time performance.

Having said that I think I'd go for a solution without irq disabling.

This needs to account for PWMCR.PRESCALER.

If endianess conversion is necessary, please apply it to the complete
driver in a separate patch. Doing this only in one place and skipping
several others is just irritating.

This checks the new period value that doesn't have to do anything with
the hardware state yet. So this check isn't sensible, is it?

period_cycles is the new overflow value.  If the current overflow value
is lower, the loop might terminate immediately. If however the current
overflow value is higher than period_cycles, the subtraction might
overflow resulting in the check to be true. In both cases there isn't
any relation to the next overflow event.

On a fast machine with a long period this might end in a timeout before
the rollover.

Why not use FIELD_GET for consistency here?

This violates the coding style. If one branch of an if needs braces, all
branches should use them.

Changing the period value resets the counter. So to minimize the effect
of the mitigation (i.e. a busy loop for up to 1.5=B5s with irqs off) I
suggest to do the wait and write SAR twice only if period doesn't change
and SAR is actually decreased over the current counter value.

duty_cycle is already 0 here, so there is no need to initialize it.
