Right, I wasn't precise enough. In my case optimal is "fastest rate <= requested rate".
This seems to be the behavior of clk core default implementations like
clk_mux_determine_rate_flags() an divider_determine_rate(), used by the meson
clock drivers.
However in general clock providers can provide their own determine_rate()
implementations. And, as a disclaimer, I have to admit that I'm no expert in CCF.

I think this would make sense. Then we could ignore the mux parent set in DT
and let CCF select the mux parent and divider value. And we could use one
pwm calc logic and get rid of most if(ext_clk).
