ir-rx51 is broken without 
https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg4953300.html, it is also missing 
a call to init_waitqueue_head() in the probe() function. So I have no 
strong opinion on what shall be done with it.

Yes, that can be done, just not sure what the overhead would be.

Also, I think we shall reconsider the way the driver works:

Imagine we have to pretend we are TV remote that supports NEC protocol 
(for example), especially the "REPEAT CODES" part. Currently, no matter 
what we do, there is no way to get the timings even remotely right, as 
we have no idea what the "warmup" and "complete" delays are. Like, 
starting thread (if needed), hrtimer setup time, completions waiting, 
contexts switching, etc.

So, I think the correct thing to do is to copy txbuf (as a list of 
txbufs) into pwm_ir in tx function, start pulses generation and return 
from pwm_ir_tx() *immediately*, without waiting for tx to finish. If 
userspace requests submission of another set of pulses while we are 
still sending the current one, well, we accept it, add it to the list 
and delay the sending until the current one is finished. When there is 
nothing more to send (the list is empty), stop the hrtimer (and perhaps 
the thread)

I think that way userspace will be able to append as many "repeat" 
pulses with proper timings as it wants (with some sane limits ofc).

Unless we somehow have API restriction that we shall not return until tx 
is finished.

Does that make any sense to you?

Thanks,
Ivo
