Let's try to explain differently then:
* So far each AML PWM IP has 2 pwm.
* Up to G12, 4 input PLL/clocks are wired to the HW IP and there=20
  mux/div/gate to select which input to take.
  - The historic bindings just described how to setup each of the 2
    internal muxes - 2 optionnal clocks.
    The actual 4 inputs names from CCF are hard coded in
    the driver. This is a pretty bad description. The driver has been
    updated since then to use CCF to figure out the best parent
    according to pwm rate so this setting is ignored now.
  - The 'new' bindings (introduced in patch #2) fixes the problem above
    but the meaning of the clock binding is different. It describes the
    actual HW parents - 4 clocks, optionnal since some are not wired on
    some PWM blocks. To avoid breaking the ABI, a new compatible for
    these SoC is introduced.

> (The driver currently doesn't support the s4, right?)

Indeed. I know Amlogic is preparing the support. I could do it in this
series but I prefer to encourage them to contribute. It should come
shortly after this series is merged.

Starting from s4 (prbably even a1 - up to people contributing this SoC
to say) the mux/div/gate is no longer in the PWM IP. It has moved to the
main clock controller. Again the clock binding describes something
different. It is the 2 input clocks of each block, they are mandatory
this time.

Apart from the compatible, no.

I don't this would be allowed by the DT maintainers.
My understanding is that the old binding doc is here to stay.
What could happen after sufficient time has past it remove the support
for the old/historic binding in the driver. Driver are not required to
support all possible bindings after all, especially if it is not used/tested
anymore.

I suppose if, elseif, else is possible.

I've done it this way because is slightly easier for human to read the
doc and find what is related to what. If you this is important for you,
I can change it.
