This is a lot to do in one go, and I think it's a bit too off on the
side and unintegrated with the core.  There's two very high level bits
here, there's the pre-cooking a message for offloading to be executed by
a hardware engine and there's the bit where that's triggered by some
hardwar event rather than by software. =20

There was a bunch of discussion of the former case with David Jander
(CCed) a while back when he was doing all the work he did on optimising
the core for uncontended uses, the thinking there was to have a
spi_prepare_message() (or similar) API that drivers could call and then
reuse the same transfer repeatedly, and even without any interface for
client drivers it's likely that we'd be able to take advantage of it in
the core for multi-transfer messages.  I'd be surprised if there weren't
wins when the message goes over the DMA copybreak size.  A much wider
range of hardware would be able to do this bit, for example David's case
was a Raspberry Pi using the DMA controller to write into the SPI
controller control registers in order to program it for multiple
transfers, bounce chip select and so on.  You could also use the
microcontroller cores that many embedded SoCs have, and even with zero
hardware support for offloading anything there's savings in the message
validation and DMA mapping.

The bit where messages are initiated by hardware is a step beyond that,
I think we need a bit more API for connecting up the triggers and we
also need to have something handling what happens with normal operation
of the device while these triggers are enabled.  I think it could be
useful to split this bit out since there's a lot more to work out there
in terms of interfaces.

This feels like something where there are likely to be multiple options
and we need configurability.  I'd also expect to see a similar transmit
option.

I would expect us to just generically prepare a message, then pass a
prepared message into the API that enables a trigger.  We would need
something that handles the difference between potentially offloading for
better performance and having a hardware trigger, I think that might be
a case of just not exposing the engine's prepare to client drivers and
then having the core track if it needs to do that when enabling a
hardware trigger.

I'm not seeing anything in this API that provides a mechanism for
configuring what triggers things to start, even in the case where things
are triggered by hardware rather than initiated by software I'd expect
to see hardware with runtime configurability.  The binding is a bit
unclear but it seems to be expecting this to be statically configured in
hardware and that there will be a 1:1 mapping between triggers and
scripts that can be configured, if nothing else I would expect that
there will be hardware with more possible triggers than scripts.

I'd also expect some treatement of what happens with the standard SPI
API while something is enabled.
