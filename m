If the lvds pll is an input to the hlcdc, you need to add it here.
=46rom your description earlier it does sound like it is an input to
the hlcdc, but now you are claiming that it is not.

I don't know your hardware, so I have no idea which of the two is
correct, but it sounds like the former. Without digging into how this
works my assumption about the hardware here looks like is that the lvds
controller is a clock provider, and that the lvds controller's clock is
an optional input for the hlcdc.

Can you please explain what provides the lvds pll clock and show an
example of how you think the devictree would look with "the lvds pll in
the lvds dt node"?

Thanks,
Conor.
