+Using PWMs with the sysfs interface
+-----------------------------------
+
+If CONFIG_SYSFS is enabled in your kernel configuration a simple sysfs
+interface is provided to use the PWMs from userspace. It is exposed at
+/sys/class/pwm/. Each probed PWM controller/chip will be exported as
+pwmchipN, where N is the base of the PWM chip. Inside the directory you
+will find:
+
+  npwm
+    The number of PWM channels this chip supports (read-only).
+
+  export
+    Exports a PWM channel for use with sysfs (write-only).
+
+  unexport
+   Unexports a PWM channel from sysfs (write-only).
+
+The PWM channels are numbered using a per-chip index from 0 to npwm-1.
+
+When a PWM channel is exported a pwmX directory will be created in the
+pwmchipN directory it is associated with, where X is the number of the
+channel that was exported. The following properties will then be available:
+
+  period
+    The total period of the PWM signal (read/write).
+    Value is in nanoseconds and is the sum of the active and inactive
+    time of the PWM.
+
+  duty_cycle
+    The active time of the PWM signal (read/write).
+    Value is in nanoseconds and must be less than the period.
+
+  polarity
+    Changes the polarity of the PWM signal (read/write).
+    Writes to this property only work if the PWM chip supports changing
+    the polarity. The polarity can only be changed if the PWM is not
