Oh, thanks for clarifying that. My assumption was that just numbering
the nodes is not informative enough, but if it's the agreed way to do
it, I will use this format instead.

I will drop this commit and correct the bindings to use 'pwm' with
no suffix as an example. (Though I still think that having a
meaningful suffix is nicer in the DT so one could see what the
node is used for)

Thanks
Nikita
