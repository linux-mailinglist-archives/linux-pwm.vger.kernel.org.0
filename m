One of the problems I see with usage_power is that it's not well
defined. The idea is that when usage_power is true, the driver is free
to implement any setting that just matches the relative duty_cycle of
the request. So if you call pwm_apply with

	.duty_cycle =3D 2000
	.period =3D 10000
	.usage_power =3D true
	.polarity =3D PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL

you can program the hardware to implement

	.duty_cycle =3D 200
	.period =3D 1000
	.polarity =3D PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL

or

	.duty_cycle =3D 8000000
	.period =3D 10000000
	.polarity =3D PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED

The expectation is however to only deviate in a sensible manner from the
request, whatever that might mean.

I don't see much value in that field, there is only one implementing
driver and no mainline user. If you're interested you can reread the
discussions about it in the archives.

Uwe
