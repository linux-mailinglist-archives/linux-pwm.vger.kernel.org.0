My idea was to do something like that:

	int mchp_core_pwm_apply(....)
	{
		if (mchp_core_pwm->sync_update_mask & (1 << pwm->hwpwm)) {
			/*
			 * We're still waiting for an update, don't
			 * interfer until it's completed.
			 */
			while (readl_relaxed(mchp_core_pwm->base + MCHPCOREPWM_SYNC_UPD)) {
				cpu_relax();
				if (waited_unreasonably_long())
					return -ETIMEOUT;
			}
		}

		update_period_and_duty(...);
		return 0;
	}

This way you don't have to wait at all if the calls to pwm_apply() are
infrequent. Of course this only works this way, if you can determine if
there is a pending update.

=46rom a simplicity POV always waiting is fine. But if you consider
periods of say 5s, letting a call to pwm_apply() do a sleep between 5
and 10 seconds at the end is quite long and blocks the caller
considerably.

I'd write: Reading the registers yields the currently implemented
settings, the new ones are only readable once the current period ended.

I wanted to say that it's okish to return from .apply() without the
sleep and so return to the caller before the requested setting appears
on the output. At least your driver wouldn't be the first to do it that
way.

I already understood it that way. I hope I was able to clarify my
thoughts above.
