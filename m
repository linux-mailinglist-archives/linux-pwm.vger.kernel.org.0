OK, so a suitable comment would be along the lines of:

	 * the values are updated from the shadow registers.

OK, so the correction below is to make up for the wrong rounding here.

IMHO it is, but the comment explaining needs some improvement. It should
also make clear why rounding cannot lead to prescale - 2 being a
good/better candidate. (I haven't thought it through, maybe needs some
improvement?) I wonder if the computation can find all improvements
given that it only used tmp, but not ->period and clk_rate?!

I missed the -=3D 1 in my example. So it's:

	It triggers for tmp =3D 511. So you prefer

		prescale =3D 1
		period_steps =3D 254

	yielding period =3D 510 / clkrate over

		prescale =3D 2
		period_steps =3D 169

	yielding 510 / clkrate.

Here it's obvious that the former is the better one. But I wonder why
the former isn't found instantly. Wouldn't

	*prescale =3D tmp / (MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX + 1) - 1

give a better approximation in general? (Of course with an additional
check that *prescale >=3D 0 then.)=20

=2E.. thinking a bit ... yes, I think that's true:

If you pick *prescale =3D tmp / (MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX + 1) - 1,
then for each period_steps value =E2=89=A4 254 we have:

	  (*prescale + 1) * (period_steps + 1)
	=E2=89=A4 (*prescale + 1) * 255
	=E2=89=A4 (tmp // (MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX + 1)) * 255
	=E2=89=A4 (tmp // 255) * 255
	=E2=89=A4 (tmp / 255) * 255
	=3D tmp

and you can use the maximal period_steps =3D 0xfe.
(Only for tmp < 255 that isn't possible, up to you if you refuse these
or pick a smaller value for period_steps.)

ack. I also wonder if such a change breaks the other assumptions a
consumer might have. I'll spend some more cycles about that in the next
round :-)

Ah, I had a bogus break statement in my python test code. So it's me
who got it wrong.
