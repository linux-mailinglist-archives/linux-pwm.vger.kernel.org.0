I doubt, time intervals we are talking about are > 500 us, which means 
fsleep will always use usleep_range() (or even worse, msleep()), see 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6-rc3/source/include/linux/delay.h#L82

Yes, I disabled all idle states on both n900 and droid4 (when doing 
cyclictest experiments), with no difference. I also locked frequency on 
n900 to 500MHz, which improved the things a bit, by some 20-50 us 
(IIRC), which makes sense, but also makes me think frequency scaling is 
not the one to blame either.

I think we can arrange one, yes, but my gut feeling tells me the issue 
is not n900 specific, it is just a bit worse there as the device is 
relatively slow already. I have no sane explanation why one would see 
similar latencies on droid4, given that it is times faster than n900.
