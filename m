Hi Jess,

as you said, I use LED directly connected to PWM logic to modify it.

As I stated in my previous article, the key is that the lower the PWM
output is, the brighter the LED light is(active-low), the higher the
PWM output is, the brighter the LED light is(active-high).

Therefore, I would point out the waveform diagram below, the output
result remains the same for the circuit, but when you use
active-low/active-high to look at it, you will get two completely
different results of brightness.

e.g. duty=3D30s, period=3D100s, actvie-high =3D 30%, active-low =3D 70%
