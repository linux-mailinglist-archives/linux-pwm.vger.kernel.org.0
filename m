Point taken as well as for other trivial ones. Replies to more complex 
ones below.

Hmm.. in fact not tested, nor near the and over the boundaries. Will check.

Ah, good to know.

Good questions. I need to spend time in the lab next week and debug :-)

Oh. I guess we copied this from pwm-lpss.c and pwm-mxs.c.

If I recall correctly I didn't see the polarity bit in HW but will 
check. Should the driver emulate it by recalculating duty etc since I 
didn't see quickly from PWM core can a driver with apply() callback 
report support for polarity?

Maybe. Will check how does it look that way.

Very good point. We probably didn't think about that.

That would be good. Will check.

I believe stopping the activity is an expectation during suspend but 
don't have the knowledge here. So in general PWM consumers should stop 
the PWM in their suspend handlers, e.g. in display panel drivers etc, 
rather than blindly stop it here? How about when PWM is enabled from sysfs?
