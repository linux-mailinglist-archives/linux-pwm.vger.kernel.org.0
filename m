Thanks for reviewing the patch. Unfortunately, I just checked 
internally,
the datasheet was not shared outside so I couldn't give a link here.

Sure, I will add a section to describe the HW properties.

Yes, this is configurable, PWM_EN_GLITCH_REMOVAL bit is for this purpose
and it's enabled by default.

No, the output stops immediately as soon as the PWM channel is disabled

Actually, the QCOM PMIC PWM module doesn't have physical pin out. Its 
output
is normally connected to other hardware module in the same PMIC as 
internal
signals, such as: control signal for LED module for scaling LED 
brightness,
input signal for vibrator module for vibration strength control. It's 
output
can also be routed through PMIC GPIO or other pin using internal DTEST
lines, and that depends on HW connection, and it will also need addition
configuration in the GPIO module or the DTEST and that's outside of the
PWM module scope.

For the output signal itself, it's always inactive when the PWM module
is disabled.

Thanks for the suggestion. I will update them all to use
FIELD_PREP(mask, val) for masking and shifting values.

sure, I will think about a better way to define the register and bit 
fields
and make sure QCOM_PWM_ prefix is present.

I am not quite sure here. You can see from the equation above, there are 
4
settings can impact PWM period calculation and each setting has an array 
of
values. We can't easily sort out the sequence of settings to achieve an 
ascending
or descending PWM periods and choose the closest one or the next 
smallest one,
instead, the logic below is to walk through all of the settings and find 
the
closest one.
I am also confused about not choosing the nearest settings but the
next smallest one, let's say if we are trying to achieve 1ms PWM period, 
and
there are three settings can get 0.90ms, 0.99ms, 1.05ms respectively
should we choose 0.99ms which is the closest one, or 1.05ms which is the 
next
smallest one?

Hmm, I am not sure how to describe the HW implementation here, but as I
explained, there are four parameters impacting the PWM period 
calculation
with different way, so the code logic here is trying to walk through all
of the the settings and find the one which can achieve the closest PWM
period.

I agree with you, but I thought it might be more meaningful to store the
physical values in "struct qcom_pwm_config" instead of the array index .

ACKed, will use (pwm_config->best_period_ns) to calculate the duty.

The PWM module can only support normal polarity, should I just ignore it
or return an error code if PWM_POLARITY_INVERSED is requested?

Hmm, it has the possibility. Normally, in one PMIC, all PWM modules 
should
have the same sub-type of PWM modules. But since each PWM module is 
accessed
independantly, so we will need to check the sub-type here for each PWM 
module.

In a single chunk do you mean by calling devm_zalloc() once?
Can you let me know how to do that? The per channel data is anothe 
pointer
which is different from the driver data, how can we make sure two 
different
pointers can be allocated in the same chunk of memory?
