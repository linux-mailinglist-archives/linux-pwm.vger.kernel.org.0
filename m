*Sigh*. We encourage the use of MIT dual-licensing as a project to allow
other OSes to port the drivers over without having to rewrite them, for
any driver written from scratch. We've had this conversation quite a few
times already...

Because they are compatible licenses. The combination of this driver and
the kernel is GPL, but this driver itself is MIT. People are free to
port it to other OSes and reimplement devm_pwmchip_add or replace the
call with something else.

The EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL stuff is about blocking *proprietary*
GPL-incompatible modules from using those symbols. This is a
GPL-compatible, explicitly dual-licensed module.

In this case the driver is trivial enough there isn't much to gain from
dual-licensing since the parts that matter (the reverse engineering) are
not copyrightable, but I still find it silly that we keep getting told
more permissive licensing is a problem. People are free to dual-license
their work as they see fit, it's a fundamental freedom in free software,
and plenty of kernel code is dual-licensed like this (including much of
DRM and entire GPU drivers).
