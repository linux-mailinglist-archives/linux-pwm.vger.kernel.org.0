Ah, it might be that it should be noinc bulk op. Need to be checked anyway.

It doesn't matter where the check is and checking that in the callee seems
better as it relies on the reset functionality. Caller in such case shouldn't
even think if it's supported or not, not their business.

Last, but not least, if you think of power management, you probably want to
assert reset there as well, means additional checks?

Is it a problem? dev_err_probe() got update in the documentation explaining
that's fine to call even in such cases. The outcome is less amount of LOCs.

It's just a feeling, because I repeating that dev_err_probe() a lot :-)
Nevertheless, now I see at least your point why you went that way.
But see my comments on it.
