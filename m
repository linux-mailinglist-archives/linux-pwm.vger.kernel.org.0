Sorry that was a misunderstanding on my part.
Yes, answer to Rob's question should have been "We have two instances of PMI632,
where one instance holds the pbs peripheral and the other holds the lpg
peripherals. The child node for pbs is needed so lpg client can access
the PMI632 regmap which contains the pbs peripheral."

Thanks,
