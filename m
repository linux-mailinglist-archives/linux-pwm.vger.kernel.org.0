I think the whole reason why the offload is being treated as a node + platf=
orm
device is to have these properties (or other possible properties depending =
on
the trigger and data capture being used) in it and so respect the HW
configuration.

While that is conceptually correct I feel that this is bringing a lot of ex=
tra
complexity. The end consumer of the offload core (which is a property/featu=
re of
the spi cotroller) are obviously the peripheral devices that in our usecase=
s are
converters and hence IIO devices. So those are the ones consuming all the d=
ata.
I saw Mark already giving some pointers and speaking about having a way to
support the triggers (being it pwm, clock, gpio, etc...) directly in the sp=
i
framework and I think that would be nice. For the dmas, I think it would be=
 more
complicated. While we can setup the dma transfer directly in the spi contro=
ller,
we would need a mechanism to transfer each block of data (periodically) as =
soon
as we have it to the peripheral device. In case of IIO, that would then hav=
e to
connect to IIO DMA buffers so the data can be consumed in userspace and tha=
t
would be the tricky part I believe.

What we have been doing out of tree is to control the trigger and dmas in t=
he
peripheral device even if that does not really directly respect the HW setu=
p (as
these are properties of the offload core). Hence, we can just allocate an I=
IO
DMA buffer, enable the offload message with the messages we want and data c=
an be
directly transferred to userspace (without any intervention of the peripher=
al
driver) using the IIO interfaces for it.

To sum it up, I think having the trigger being handled by the spi framework=
 or
even have it as an IIO generic trigger would be simple. To have the dma
transfers in the spi controller would be more complex but anything is possi=
ble,
I guess :).
