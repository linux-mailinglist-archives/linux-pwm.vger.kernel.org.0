Thank you very much for pointing out the issue. I did miss the normal path:(

There is another path of double-disabling: pwm_sifive_enable() may disable
ddata->clk as required by the 'enable' flag.
pwm_sifive_apply() calls it and passes the flag. However, there is
a clk_disable(ddata->clk) just below invoking pwm_sifive_enable()
in pwm_sifive_apply().
