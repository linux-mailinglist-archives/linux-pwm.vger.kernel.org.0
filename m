Hi

Thanks for review.

Yes, I'm blind, will fix :-)

Ah, forgot to mention that on my change log. I was too hurry for weekend 
I guess... So no, I didn't find public spec but will check again.

I'll check and see.

Yes it's now on in my .config files. I don't remember did I try with 
zero duty. Which is actually not possible in this HW, nor 100 %. Minimum 
for both high and low periods is one clock cycle.

Yes.

I forgot also this from the changelog. I was testing this with a script 
toggling minor 1 step duty cycle changes back and forth in a 1 s loop 
using relatively long period (a few seconds IIRC) and didn't see 
differences with or without disabling. Not sure was that methodology 
correct.

However, usage flow in the spec says that timer must be disabled before 
writing load counter registers "in order to avoid potential 
synchronization problems" so best to document it here.

Yes to both. Will add.

Or, would it make sense to convert period and duty_cycle in PWM core to 
64-bit? I'm fine to both commenting capping here or changing the period 
and duty to 64-bit.

That (%pe I guess?) looks awesome! Will certainly add.

Yes for pci_enable_device(), pcim_enable_device() is the managed one.
