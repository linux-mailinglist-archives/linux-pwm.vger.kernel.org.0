      active-low:

I would suspect that it was written with that assumption.
Probably was the case on the specific board this property was originally
added for.

Maybe it'd be a bit more foolproof written as "For LEDs that are
illuminated while the PWM output is low. For example, where an LED is
wired between supply and the PWM output."?
