However if there are still 3 pending SAR values you don't need to write
twice. So waiting for a single free slot should be good enough.

Did you test with local_irq_save() instead of the spin_lock?=20

Maybe disable the PWM on reconfiguration? That is, clear the enable bit,
then the counter stops (and output freezes). Then you can check for a
word in the fifo, add one or two and reenable the PWM.

Then you don't have to disable irqs at all and only increase the current
period by by the time you need to setup the new settings.

Did you verify that the compiler understood your wish and that splitting
the call to writel_relaxed() indeed improves the situation?

You didn't get what I wanted to point out here. Consider the PWM is
currently running with period =3D 100 ns. Then .apply is called,
requesting period =3D 3000 ns. Your code then does the wait dance because
the new value is big enough. However it's the currently configured value
that should be considered to judge if the dance is required.

The check is sound, however your suggested implementation is wrong.

uah, no. Please stick to unsigned and just fix the test.

If the currently running period lasts 1.4 =C2=B5s at function entry you
intend to wait for 1.4 =C2=B5s, right? You check up to 1000 times if the
1.4=C2=B5s are already over. If each check takes 1 ns, you only wait 1=C2=
=B5s.
While this probably doesn't happen because in the future a check will
take longer than 1.5ns for quite some time, it's bad style and a bad
template for someone implementing something similar on a different
machine where the timings are different.

I would expect that using FIELD_GET does result in the same code being
generated. So the only effect is to make this more readable to a human
reader.
