You're right, for long PWM periods, the application of changes will take 
longer.

As far as I can tell, the method implemented in this patch may still 
suffer from the problem in case of short PWM periods, is that correct ? 
I think the writesl() might help cover some of that.

Maybe for longer PWM periods (like 500ms and longer?) where we can be 
sure the FIFO won't quickly consume the written data and underflow, we 
can do writesl() with only two longwords {old_sar, new_sar}, first 
longword to make sure the FIFO is not empty, second word with the new 
PWMSAR value ? That could speed the update up ?

> The currect method, most time, the new value will effect at next period.
Yes, right, I think we may have to handle the longer PWM periods somehow 
differently.

I would like to avoid local_irq_save()/readl_poll_timeout_atomic() if 
possible and let the hardware help avoid this, which I think is possible 
with creative loading of the FIFO with data, hence the writesl() idea.

What do you think about the option above ?

My usecase is mainly display PWM backlight dimming, so those periods 
there are in some 100..2000 Hz or so.
