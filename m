Seems like a good idea, though we'll have to be careful to communicate
this lopause+t value for the first entry and hipause+t for the
middle/last (through a dev_err I suppose) in case we reject values that
don't strictly adhere to this math.

I've seen two other dirvers document the hw_pattern sysfs property under
Documentation/leds/.  Should be easier to find than a comment inside the
respective function deep in the kernel source tree I presume?

Quoting Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-trigger-pattern for
this sysfs property:

    Since different LED hardware can have different semantics of
    hardware patterns, each driver is expected to provide its own
    description for the hardware patterns in their documentation
    file at Documentation/leds/.

Doesn't need to be anything long, copying your inline comment would be a
great start.  Thanks!
