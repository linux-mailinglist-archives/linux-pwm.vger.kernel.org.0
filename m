The bls_debug register is used to both enable and/or disable various features,
including the one that I'm targeting in this commit, which is disabling shadow
registers.

As I explained in the commit message, we don't want to - and cannot - assume that
the bootloader doesn't *reset* the backlight controller before booting Linux: a
reset would re-enable the shadow registers, and this function being called as
first to check the backlight EN status may fail to do so.

This is as well true in the opposite situation where, in the future, we may want
to set shadow registers ON, while the bootloader sets them OFF before booting:
adding a (x && !has_commit) check in this branch would defeat that purpose and
make this commit... well.. partially broken! :-)

Cheers!
Angelo
