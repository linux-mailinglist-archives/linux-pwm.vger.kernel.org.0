This was copied from the specification which now that you mention it,
seems off by one in its formula, it should be <=. This is further
confirmed with:

pwm1_cword[15:0] must be less than or equal to 32768 when the
variable-frequency PWM is used as a clock for the constant-frequency PWM.
Reset value is 0x0.

so I believe that the comment is wrong and so is the specification of
the block that was used to write the driver.

That is right.

Yes, that is also what the specification says, not sure why I wrote that
down TBH.

I wish, this was 7 years ago, and I do not remember why there was a +1
being added here, it might have been that this should have been a
DIV_ROUND_UP().

I am slowly rebuilding some context here so if you want me to test
something in the meantime, I will do that.
