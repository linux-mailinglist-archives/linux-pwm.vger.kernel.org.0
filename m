Could you elaborate on the "pwm-ir-tx driver does suffer from this 
problem"? Where do you see that?

ir-rx51 does not suffer from the same problem (albeit it has its own 
one, see bellow)

usleep_range() is backed by hrtimers already, however the difference 
comes from how hrtimer is used in ir-rx51: it uses timer callback 
function that gets called in softirq context, while usleep_range() puts 
the task in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state and then calls 
schedule_hrtimeout_range(). For some reason it takes at least 200-400 us 
(on average) even on OMAP4 to switch back to TASK_RUNNING state.

The issue with ir-rx51 and the way it uses hrtimers is that it calls 
pwm_apply_state() from hrtimer function, which is not ok, per the 
comment here 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6-rc3/source/drivers/pwm/core.c#L502

I can make pwm-ir-tx switch to hrtimers, that's not an issue, but I am 
afraid that there is some general scheduler or timers (or something 
else) issue that manifests itself with usleep_range() misbehaving.

I have and once I have an idea what's going on will port pwm-ir-tx to 
hrtimers, if needed. Don't want to do it now as I am afraid the 
completion I will have to use will have the same latency problems as 
usleep_range()
