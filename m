I think the problem for me was that my server, for some reason,
insisted on using ipv6 which it has no access to. I think it might
just be some (very) temporary problem on my end as now the mails go
fine again.

And the missing "g" is just the artifact of me preferring to manually
build the git send-email command every time, then forgetting I made
this typo when replying...

Thanks for the suggestion!

Yes, I decided to immediately send a v8 instead of giving a bit
of time for the discussion to settle (which seem to often end up
too long) as there was no functional change otherwise.

Thanks,
Nikita
