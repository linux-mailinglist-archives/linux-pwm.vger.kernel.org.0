*sigh*, me again...

Picked this up this afternoon to try and respin a v14 and ran into a bit
of an issue with this suggestion:

> > 	*prescale =3D div_u64(tmp, MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX)
> > 	if (*prescale)

In theory this works out, but with integer division it doesn't AFAICT.

Take for example:
period_ns =3D 10,000
clk_rate =3D 62.5 MHz

The prescale calculation is:
(10000 * 62.5E6) / (1E9 * 255) - 1 =3D 1.451 -> 1

For period_steps then:
(10000 * 62.5E6) / (1E9 * (1 + 1)) - 1 =3D 311.5 -> 311

prescale is a u16, since it's valid for that division to return 256.
The register is only 8 bits wide though, so 311 overflows it and 55 ends
up in the register.
The period then is:
(55 + 1) * (1 + 1) / 62.5E6, or a period of 1792 ns.

I think it needs to be a div_u64_round_up(), which I know is not a real
function, otherwise we compute invalid values for period steps.

Quoting you previously:

As we need (period_steps + 1) * (prescale + 1) maximal, *but* also want
to maximise period_steps so that duty resolution etc is maximal too.
We pick prescale, using the formula below, by setting period_steps to
the maximum possible value:
> 	            period * clk_rate
> 	prescale =3D -------------------
> 	           NSEC_PER_SEC * 0xff

Given we set period_steps to the max here, we only actually pick the
lower bound on prescale, not the actual value of it.
We must round it to the nearest possible value before using it to go
back and calculate period_steps.

With the previous code, missing the -=3D 1, the division result was purely
truncated:
(10000 * 62.5E6) / (1E9 * 255) =3D 2.451 -> 2
That 2 was written into the register, and then the hardware rounds that
up to 3, as does the period_steps calculation.

period_steps here is:
(10000 * 62.5E6) / (1E9 * (2 + 1)) - 1 =3D 207.833 -> 207

Finally, the period:
(207 + 1) * (2 + 1) / 62.5E6, or a period of 9984 ns.

This is the same operation, unless I am yet again overlooking something,
as doing a div_u64_round_up() type thing, followed by a subtraction of 1

We don't need to worry about writing something too big into the register
either, as we are protected against values of tmp that, when divided by
0xff, would produce values larger than 255:

> 	*period_steps =3D MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX - 1;
>=20
> 	return;

What am I missing this time? haha

Thanks,
Conor.
