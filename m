Fbdev has separate (orthogonal) settings for
  1. Frame buffer layout (FB_TYPE_*),
  2. Pixel format (depth and fb_bitfields),
  3. Visual.
DRM combines all of the above in a fourcc value.

Nowadays most frame buffer layouts are packed, so using a shadow
frame buffer to support other layouts is very helpful, as it means
applications no longer have to care about legacy frame buffer layouts.

Agreed, the only thing that matters is a monotonic mapping, and
whether it's increasing or decreasing.

That's an option. If the data has to be copied anyway, inversion is
a cheap operation. Else I think you need new fourcc types.

Yeah, it's complicated, but rather rare. Most desktop hardware
(even from the nineties ;-) does support a programmable palette.
Exceptions are CGA, the C64 (no Linux support yet ;-), and eInk
displays that support e.g. white, black, and red.

If you do want to support it, perhaps introduce Fx (F = fixed)
fourcc types?

Fine, as said above, monotonic mapping is what matters.
