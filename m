I solved that in the past on our board the same way as other imx6 boards
did. Just override the #pwm-cells property in your board specific devicetree
and you are fine:

   linux-src$ git grep pwm-cells -- arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6*-*
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6dl-yapp4-common.dtsi:     #pwm-cells = <3>;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6q-display5.dtsi:  #pwm-cells = <3>;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6q-mccmon6.dts:    #pwm-cells = <3>;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6qdl-tx6.dtsi:     #pwm-cells = <3>;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6qdl-tx6.dtsi:     #pwm-cells = <3>;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6ul-tx6ul.dtsi:    #pwm-cells = <3>;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6ull-colibri.dtsi: #pwm-cells = <3>;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6ull-colibri.dtsi: #pwm-cells = <3>;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6ull-colibri.dtsi: #pwm-cells = <3>;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6ull-colibri.dtsi: #pwm-cells = <3>;
