The first thing I'd like to get sorted is should we rename this to
snps,dw-apb-timers-pwm so we can rename the file and the compatible
that goes with it.

I believe the driver should cover a large part of the v1.xx cores
as well, we just don't have any documentation for these to verify
this.

The document as-such should cover everything I have a log for, we've not
had time to test the extension for 0or100% which was introduced in 2.11a
spec. The earliest history I have is 2.02d. I will go and see if I can
find someone who can go look for anything earlier.

As a note, it does look like all the v2.xx cores have the IP version
register in them so we can auto-detect the version from that, at least
for the DT/platform case.
