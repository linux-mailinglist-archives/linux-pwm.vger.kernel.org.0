I came into work today thinking that I could just rebase on top of your
patchset and send out a v13, but that was unfortunately not the case :/

So uh, it turns out that I was wrong about the behaviour of the
sync_update register's bit.
It turns out that that bit holds it's value until the IP block is reset,
and /does not/ get cleared at the start of the next period.
I'm really not sure how it worked when I tested the other week [0], so I
spent the first half of the day trying to figure out what on earth had
happened to my FPGA image. I must've picked the wrong image when I went
to test it the other week that had the wrong configuration somehow.

As a result, I've gone and hacked up another way of transferring the
burden of waiting - setting a timer for the period, backed by a
completion. get_state() and apply() now both check for the completion
and time out otherwise. I'm half tempted to tack RFC back onto the
series as I have not really messed with timers at all before and may
have done something off the wall.

I pushed it out (see [1] in case you'd like to look) so that the bots
can have a play with it, since it'll be a few weeks before I'll have a
chance to properly test that I've broken nothing with this.

It's not nearly as neat or contained, but still benefits from the
non-void get_state() & doesn't "confuse" a caller of get_state() with
some potential garbage.

The diff on top of the read_poll_timeout() approach from above is pasted
here. Hopefully I'll refine it a bit before sending a v13, checkpatch
may have an aneurysm with what's below. Or have a better idea and throw
it out..

Thanks again for sending that v2 ~immediately,
Conor.
