Yes, I did consider this. Because the downstream driver is (at least was
when I looked at it originally) split like that.


We have a number of different Qualcomm PMICs containing the LPG modules,
which consists of N PWM channels, a pattern lookup table and a set of
current sinks.

Each PWM channel can either be used as a traditional PWM, a LED or be
grouped together with other channels to form a multicolor LED. So we
need a design that allows different boards using a particular PMIC to
freely use the N channels according to one of these three operational
modes.

The pattern lookup table is a shared resource containing duty cycle
values and each of the PWM channels can be configured to have their duty
cycle modified from the lookup table on some configured cadence.

In the even that multiple PWM channels are ganged together to form a
multicolor LED, which is driven by a pattern, the pattern generator for
the relevant channels needs to be synchronized.


If we consider the PWM channel to be the basic primitive we need some
mechanism to configure the pattern properties for each of the channels
and we need some mechanism to synchronize the pattern generators for
some subset of the PWM channels.


In other words we need some custom API between the LED driver part and
the PWM driver, to configure these properties. This was the design
of the downstream driver when I started looking at this driver.


Another alternative that has been considered is to create two
independent drivers - for the same hardware. This would allow the system
integrator to pick the right driver for each of the channels.

One problem with this strategy is that the DeviceTree description of the
LPG hardware will have to be modified depending on the use case. In
particular this prevents me from writing a platform dtsi describing the
LPG hardware and then describe the LEDs and pwm channels in a board dts.

And we can't express the individual channels, because the multicolor
definition needs to span multiple channels.


So among all the options, implementing the pwm_chip in the LED driver
makes it possible for us to describe the LPG as one entity, with
board-specific LEDs and a set of PWM channels.

I guess I can split out the parts related to the pwmchip in a separate
patch. Seems to be a rather small portion of the code though. Is that
what you have in mind?

We spent considerable time going through this last time, so I hope we're

Yes, a disabled channel outputs a logical 0.

I see nothing indicating the answer to this, in either direction...

For previous iterations of the patch yes, v11 didn't touch any of that
so I omitted that step... Will enable it again as I respin v12.
