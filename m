I don't have the datasheets/spec/manual for this, so I have no clue what
is it. I know though that calling it generic "pwm" is a bit too generic.

For example "snps,dw-apb-timer" is not called "snps,timer" but
DesignWare APB Timer.

Yeah, but I still don't understand what is the problem to solve in
bindings for that.

Several of them might be actually compatible, so you might not need 100
different compatibles. Patterns are not allowed.

I doubt that PWM block is much more complicated than for example DW MAC,
which somehow can exist with few versions defined...

Auto-detection is then preferred, so just call it -v2.02d which will
cover all known v2 for you and the rest is done via autodetection.
