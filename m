RZ/G2L General PWM Timer (GPT) composed of 8 channels with 32-bit timer
(GPT32E). It supports the following functions
 * 32 bits Ã— 8 channels
 * Up-counting or down-counting (saw waves) or up/down-counting
   (triangle waves) for each counter.
 * Clock sources independently selectable for each channel
 * Two I/O pins per channel
 * Two output compare/input capture registers per channel
 * For the two output compare/input capture registers of each channel,
   four registers are provided as buffer registers and are capable of
   operating as comparison registers when buffering is not in use.
 * In output compare operation, buffer switching can be at crests or
   troughs, enabling the generation of laterally asymmetric PWM waveforms.
 * Registers for setting up frame cycles in each channel (with capability
   for generating interrupts at overflow or underflow)
 * Generation of dead times in PWM operation
 * Synchronous starting, stopping and clearing counters for arbitrary
   channels
 * Starting, stopping, clearing and up/down counters in response to input
   level comparison
 * Starting, clearing, stopping and up/down counters in response to a
   maximum of four external triggers
 * Output pin disable function by dead time error and detected
   short-circuits between output pins
 * A/D converter start triggers can be generated (GPT32E0 to GPT32E3)
 * Enables the noise filter for input capture and external trigger
   operation

This patch series aims to add basic pwm support for RZ/G2L GPT driver
by creating separate logical channels for each IOs.

v14->v15:
* Added enable_count and ch_en_bits variables to struct rzg2l_gpt_chip
  based on feedback for pwm_mtu3 driver.
* Updated copyright header and commit description by replacing "This patch
  adds"-> "Add"
* Replaced macro RZG2L_GET_CH_INDEX->RZG2L_GET_CH and replaced ch_index->ch
  throughout
* rzg2l_gpt_{enable,disable}() enables/disables PWM based on the
  enable_count.
* Replaced pm_runtime_get_sync->pm_runtime_resume_and_get and propogated
  the error in rzg2l_gpt_get_state() and rzg2l_gpt_config()
* Reduced variable scope in rzg2l_gpt_get_state() by moving most of variables
  inside the if statement.
* Updated rzg2l_gpt_get_state() by moving duty > period check
  inside the top if block.
* Added helper functions rzg2l_gpt_calculate_pv_or_dc()to simplify config. 
  Also Improved the logic in rzg2l_gpt_calculate_pv_or_dc() by using
  min(period_or_duty_cycle >> (2 * prescale), (u64)U32_MAX);
* Updated rzg2l_gpt_get_state() by moving duty > period check
  inside the top if block.
* Simplified rzg2l_gpt_config() for updating registers
* Dropped pm_runtime_get_sync() and used bitmap variable "ch_en_bits"
  to make balanced PM usage count in rzg2l_gpt_reset_assert_pm_disable()
  For case were unbind is called before apply where pwm is enabled by
  bootloader.
* Added error check for clk_rate_exclusive_get() and clk_get_rate() in
  probe().
* Dropped prescale from struct rzg2l_gpt_chip.
* Replaced of_match_ptr(rzg2l_gpt_of_table)->rzg2l_gpt_of_table in struct
  rzg2l_gpt_driver
* Updated commit description of patch#4 by replacing "This patch add"->
  "Add".
v13->v14:
* Moved the patch from series[1] to here.

 * Started using DEFINE_RUNTIME_DEV_PM_OPS(), and dropped __maybe_unused
   from the callbacks.
v11->v12:
