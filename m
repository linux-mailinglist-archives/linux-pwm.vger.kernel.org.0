I believe that there are two common approaches by userspace at present:

1. Assume the scale is perceptual and we can directly map a slider
   to the backlight value. This is common simply because most ACPI
   backlights are perceptual and therefore when tested in a laptop
   it works OK.

2. Assume that is max brightness is small (e.g. ACPI) then the
   scale is perceptual and if the max brightness is large (e.g.
   a PWM) then the scale is linear and apply a correction
   function between the slider and the control.

That historic baggage makes is diffcult to "just define a standardized
scale"... especially given that if we selected a standardized scale we
would probably want a perceptual scale with lots of steps (e.g. break
the heuristic).

My view is that this convergence will eventually be achieved but it will
happen through the obsolescence of the backlight sysfs interface. The
sysfs interface has other flaws, in particular no integration with the
DRM connector API.

Thus I would expect an alternative interface to emerge, most likely as
part of the DRM connector API. I'd expect such a new API to a
perceptual scale and to have a fixed max brightness with enough
steps to support animated backlight effects (IIRC 0..100 has been
proposed in the past) 

In the mean time getting the existing collection of backlight drivers
marked up as linear/logarithmic/etc will ease the introduction of that
API because, within the kernel, we might have gathered enough knowledge
to have some hope of correctly mapping each backlight onto a
standardized scale.
