Hey Uwe,
Thanks (as always). I've switched up my email setup a bit so I hope
that I've not mangled anything here.

Big endian? What's that? ;)
I think the cast can just be dropped and the u16 used directly instead.

What I wrote is _fine_ but the could is redudant given the possible.
I'll change it over.

Yeah, I guess the comment could reflect that.

Riiight. I think I am a little confused here - this comment does not
refer to my comment but rather to the whole logic I have?

As in, what you're concerned about is the early exit if the state is
disabled & that I take the values in the hardware as accurate?

What makes sense to me to do here (assuming I understood correctly)
is to compare state->period against what is in the hardare rather than
against what the pwm core thinks?
Or else I could stop exiting early if the pwm is to be disabled &
instead allow the period and duty to be set so that the state of the
hardware is as close to the pwm core's representation of it as possible.

Keeping the core's interpretation as close to correct as possible seems
like a good idea to me - my only concern is that the apply() will fail.
But if I have read & understand the core code correctly, the core will
not update pwm->state from {.duty = 0, .period = A, .enabled = true}
if callying apply with {.duty = 0, .period = B, .enabled = false}
fails?

Much simplier at the cost of 4 lines sounds objective to me!

I don't think this is ever going to be hit in the wild, since prescale
comes from the hardware where it is limited to 255 - but preventing the
issue seems trivially done by splitting the multiplication so no reason
not to. Thanks for providing the test program btw :)

Because I was running into conflicts between the reporting here and some
of the checks that I have added to prevent the PWM being put into an
invalid state. On boot both negedge and posedge will be zero & this was
preventing me from setting the period at all.

Sure, I'll move it after the last register access.
