Will do -- makes sense.

Right. It has to be enabled in order to access the registers, and it
also simultaneously enables the actual output. What you are suggesting
makes perfect sense to me. I will play with that approach for V2.

You are absolutely correct. I had noticed that case was possible, but it
didn't click in my head that setting duty_cycle to 0 when disabling
would work around it. I need to set duty_cycle to 0 when disabling the
PWM anyway, because it seems to have a tendency to get stuck high when
stopping the clock.

I also realized I forgot to submit one other patch to allow this driver
to be selected with ARCH_MMP (which the PXA168 belongs to). I will
include that with V2 as well.

Thanks for reviewing this so quickly and providing great feedback!

Doug
