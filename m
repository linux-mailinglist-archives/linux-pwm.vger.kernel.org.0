There are two things to consider:

 - usually the hardware doesn't support all requestable states because
   the hardware's quantum is > 1 ns. That is, it might for example
   support periods in the form (160 ns * i / 3) for i in 1 .. 1023.

   If this hardware runs with i =3D 500 (that is period ~=3D 26666.66
   ns) because the first channel is configured to run with period =3D
   26667, and .request is called for the 2nd channel with .period =3D
   26700 ns, there is no need to refuse that, because 26666.66 is the
   best possible approximation for 26700 ns anyhow.

 - .apply is supposed to implement the highest possible period that
   isn't bigger than the requested period. So in the above case even if
   the hardware runs at 26666.66 ns without the possibility to change
   that, a request to configure for period =3D 30000 ns could succeed (and
   keep 26666.66 ns).

Note that the above implements the optimal behaviour for a driver.
(For some definition of "optimal" that admittedly also yields strange
behaviour at times. The reasoning for this to the be thing to implement
is, that's the corner cases are easier to implement, idempotency is
possible and it's easier to work with than rounding to the nearest
possible value.)

While I'd like to see the sifive driver to implement this optimal
behaviour, it's not mandatory that you convert the driver to that
behaviour. Just make sure to not make it worse.

So to answer your question: If you understood what I wrote above and are
motivated to improve the driver, it would be great to do that before the
next review round.

Best regards
Uwe
