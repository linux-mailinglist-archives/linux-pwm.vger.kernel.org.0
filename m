Unfortunately not. But it should be easy enough and I'll describe it
briefly in the header.

Ok.

Shouldn't we just "#define ..MODE_250HZ 1" use FIELD_PREP inside the 
code,
so you can actually use the normalized enumeration values, too?

Actually, I'll rename the PWM_MODE to PWM_PRESCALER, because that is
more accurate.

I had used FIELD_GET only for bit-fields with more than one bit,
i.e. no flags. But that is just a matter of taste, I guess. I'd
prefer to keep the simple "reg & PWM_ENABLE". If you insist on
the FIELD_GET() I'll change it ;)

The reason I introduced a lookup table here was that I need a
list of the supported modes; I wasn't aware of the rounding.
See also below.

What is that helper for then? The former versions did the same
calculations (i.e. DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL()) just open coded. But
I guess then it was also rounding the wrong way.

Is there any written documentation on how to round, i.e. up or down?
I had a look Documentation/driver-api/pwm.rst again. But couldn't find
anything. A grep DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL() turns out that quite a few
drivers use it, so I did the same ;)

I see. In this case I can of course drop the table. But the rounding
will be then very coarse for this driver. And there is no way to get
the value which is actually set, right? You can just read the cached
value. So that value might be far off the actual one set in the
hardware.

During testing I've also found the following problem: Assume we set
a period of 5000000ns; this will be rounded to 4000000ns and written
to the hardware. But the usable duty cycle is still 0..5000000ns. The
driver will translate this input in the following manner:
  - 0..4000000 -> 0%..100%
  - >4000000 -> 100%
Is this behavior intended? Even for PWM hardware which supports finer
grained frequencies there will be some upper and lower limits. Is
the user of the PWM supposed to know these?

Mh, this made me think where that "magic" number is coming from. Turns
out this is the NSECS_PE_SEC / base clock of the PWM.

I guess I'll rework the get_state() and apply() to just use this
base frequency, dropping the table etc.

Btw what about the polarity. Do I have to support it or can I
return an error code if its != PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL? If so, which
error code? EINVAL? I know I could just invert the duty cycle in
software, but shouldn't this be done in the core for any controller
which doesn't support changing the polarity in hardware?

why is that? The only drawback is that the mode is changed without
the user seeing it. But the PWM subsystem returns the cached state,
right? get_state() is called only on device request (and during
debug it seems). Actually, enabling PWM_DEBUG might choke on this
workaround (".apply didn't pick the best available period"). Is
this ok?

Yes, but technically, any value above 0x40 will do it. But you
are correct, that is wrong and misleading.

Isn't that always the case if a write may fail and there are more than
one register to configure? For example, have a look at pwm-iqs620a.c.
Btw. the get_state might also fail, but there is no return value to
return the error.

Sure. There might be (or most likely are) gliches when you change the
mode.
