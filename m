I am not going to accept this patch as-is. If userspace wants to have
values accurate down to ms, this kind of approach is just wrong. Users
will have to live with the fact that measurements may be a bit (in the 
< 1 second range) out of date. Many older drivers even implement code
which avoids reading registers again for a second or longer. Older
temperature sensors may take several seconds to provide new readings.
That is not a reason to block userspace until a new value is available.
I do not see that as a problem. In my opinion it is much more of a
problem if the driver returns a completely bad value such as 0 or even
an error code because its software parameters did not match reality and
the driver didn't wait long enough for a new value. That would be _much_
worse than providing a value which is a few 100 ms out of date, and your
code is vulnerable to that problem.

Besides, for a fan to reduce its speed that quickly, it has to be manually
stopped. Normally fans take several seconds to stop if power is taken away
completely. Your code is adding a lot of complexity (and unnecessary
attributes) for no good reason.
