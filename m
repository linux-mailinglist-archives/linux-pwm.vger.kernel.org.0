Sounds reasonable. I'll try to capture some of this background in the
commit message, for future reference.

It allow you to have the hardware adjust the duty cycle over time, to
implement things such as fading or pulsing light effects - without
having to use the CPU.

I will give it a try and see what I can deduce, and update the comment
accordingly.

Right, with a freshly probed driver I would return period = 0,
duty_cycle = 0/511 and enabled = 0.

Am I expected to instead return the hardware state, e.g. to recover
hardware initialization provided by the bootloader?
