Well, this is a bit of a gray area, admittedly. .get_state() was not
designed with regards to drivers that are unable to read the hardware
state. Essentially if you can't read the full hardware state, the
assumption was that you just shouldn't provide a .get_state() callback
at all.

In retrospect that's perhaps not ideal, and as you pointed out this is
all a bit moot as of v6.3 because the initial state is now effectively
zeroed out already.

But just to address your point about enabled =3D false being enough: it's
not. The reason is that consumers should be able to do something along
these lines:

	pwm_get_state(pwm, &state);
	state.enabled =3D true;
	pwm_apply_state(pwm, &state);

And expect the device to do something reasonable. If the PWM isn't
properly configured, that pwm_apply_state() should return an error. If
->get_state() returned random values, that may not be guaranteed. With
v6.3, the above should return -EINVAL for pwm-atmel because period ends
up being 0 and we check for that explicitly. And that's really the only
sane behavior for drivers that can't read back the full hardware state.

Again, since we have this in the core that should be good enough. But it
is still something that drivers need to be aware about. If you can't
determine a real value from hardware readout, period and duty-cycle
should be zeroed out so that consumers don't end up applying garbage
values accidentally.
