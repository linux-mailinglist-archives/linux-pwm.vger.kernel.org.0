Hi Thierry,

No objection from me, it will probably improve readability.

I'd just suggest an alternative to this: maybe a simple struct array
with two entries can improve readability ? E.g. keep the defines
matching the datasheet, and get rid of the conditional code ?

Dirty proposal:

static const struct stm32_pwm_brk[] = {
	/* {bke, bkp, shift, mask} */
	{ TIM_BDTR_BKE, TIM_BDTR_BKP, ...},
	{ TIM_BDTR_BK2E, TIM_BDTR_BK2P, ...},
}

and use "index" to index it ?

But I'm fine with the macros as well: there's already similar things in
this driver to deal with the channels for instance.

Thanks,
Fabrice
