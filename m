I don't particularily like that. While state->period is an invalid
value, IMHO enabled =3D false is enough information from the driver's POV.

In my book code that calls pwm_get_state() should consider .period
(and .duty_cycle) undefined if .enabled is false. So this hunk is an
improvement. Having said that, I think pwm_adjust_config() has a strange
semantic. I don't understand when you would want to call it, and it only
has one caller (i.e. pwm-regulator).

So another option would be

diff --git a/drivers/regulator/pwm-regulator.c b/drivers/regulator/pwm-regu=
lator.c

and drop pwm_adjust_config() as a followup?!

I wonder why you picked .enabled =3D true here but =3D false on all other
code locations.

Also you don't seem to have 1271a7b98e7989ba6bb978e14403fc84efe16e13
which has the same effect and is included in v6.3 and v6.2.13.

Best regards
Uwe
