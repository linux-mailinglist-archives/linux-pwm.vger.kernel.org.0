They are both for greybus, which is what you advertise in the subject
line.  And the sense of the changes is the same, and the changes are quite
simple.  So I think you could just put them in one patch.  If you find
other occurrences of the problem in greybus you could make one patch that
fixes all of them.

A patchset is needed if the changes affect the same file, because there
might be complications if the patches are applied in the wrong order.

RESEND would be if you send exactly the same thing, because some time has
passed and you are worried that the patch has been lost.  Now that you
have put these in a series, it is perhaps best to leave them in a series
and increase the version number, to avoid confusion on the part of people
reading the patches.
