That part looks fine. pwm_get_relative_duty_cycle() is only sensible for
an enabled PWM.

This could be abbreviated to:

	else
		voltage =3D min(max_uV_duty, min_uV_duty);

which you might find easier or harder to read.

Note this isn't save in general. You're implicitly assuming that a
disabled PWM runs with the minimal supported duty_cycle. Most disabled
PWMs yield the inactive level (which corresponds to a 0% relative duty
cycle). But there are exceptions. Also if your regulator has

	pwm-dutycycle-range =3D <20 80>;
	pwm-dutycycle-unit =3D <100>;

a 0% relative duty cycle yields an undefined voltage.

Without claiming to understand all implications, I'd say
pwm_regulator_get_voltage should signal to the caller when the
duty_cycle isn't contained in [min(max_uV_duty, min_uV_duty),
max(max_uV_duty, min_uV_duty)].

With that implemented, I'd just do:

	if (pstate.enabled)
		voltage =3D pwm_get_relative_duty_cycle(&pstate, duty_unit);
	else
		/*
		 * We're assuming here that a disabled PWM yields a 0%
		 * relative duty cycle. This isn't true in general
		 * however. Maybe issue a warning here?!
		 */
		voltage =3D 0;

Best regards
Uwe
