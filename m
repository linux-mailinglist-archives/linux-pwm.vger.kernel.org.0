If acceptable this could be done as a follow-up patch.

As of today this pattern just creates overhead because clk_hw_register()
builds on top of __clk_register() and therefore creates a consumer,
and devm_clk_hw_get_clk() creates a second consumer. But I see the point.

Situation may change once clk_hw_register() is re-implemented and doesn't
create a consumer any longer.
