If you have any specific questions then feel free to ask.
Generally it's a very simple PWM controller:
- when disabled the output is LOW
- when enabled the output matches the requested period and duty cycle
as best as possible (depending on the available input clocks)

The vendor BSP includes a custom u-boot with lots of relevant
information for which there's seemingly no documentation.
It seems that 1.1V is what should be used during normal operation.
0.86V is what can be used during system suspend (when power to the
Cortex-A5 cores is turned off and an integrated ARC core is taking
over for wakeup purposes).
Hence the supported voltage range of 0.86..1.1V


Best regards,
Martin
