First of all, I'm truly delighted to see your nice PWM v4 driver codes. 
I was once intensely struggling with porting the v4 PWM implementation 
into the Linux 6.1 ââPWM framework. ;-)

The 24MHz OSC clock source is mainly for the use of the IR input, which 
is also called the power key capture mode. When the system enters 
suspend state, it relies on the OSC to ensure the PWM remains 
operational and can serve as a system wake-up source.

In addition, the PWM v4 also supports the 400KHz RC clock source for the 
wave generator mode, and it can be used for the deeper sleep state.

I'm eagerly looking forward to your v2 patch submission, and I will 
thoroughly validate the proper functioning of the PWM 
backlight/regulator based on your code changes.
