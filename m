I've become really disenfranchised with these register/variable names.
I feel like just changing them to disconnect the variables used for
calculation from the register names a little, so that the "is there a +1
needed here or not" stuff becomes a little clearer.
It always makes sense to be when I am in an "I respun the patch today"
mode, but by the time we're in the review stage I get muddled.
God forbid I have to look at this in 10 years time.

That said, there is a bit of a mistake here. The comment two above says
"Therefore period_steps is restricted to 0xFE" when I'm capping things
off. Some inaccuracies have probably snuck in during the various
respins, and I think the comment above is "correct" but misleading, as
it muddies the waters about variable versus register names.

Correct. I'll update the comments with an explanation as to what the
objective is, rather than just referring to it as "optimal".

I'll have to think about it too, I'll clear a space among the todo-lists
on my whiteboard tomorrow or Friday and get back to you...

No, this is me realising that I had a misconception about how that
register works. You write the bit once, and it enables the mode for
channels that have been configured that way at synthesis-time, rather
than how I somehow thought it worked which was as a "flush" from the
shadow registers into the "real" ones.

Sure, can do!
