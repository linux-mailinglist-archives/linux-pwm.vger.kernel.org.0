The pwm-ir-tx driver does suffer from this problem, but I was under the
impression that the ir-rx51 has the same problem.

pwm-ir-tx uses usleep_range() and ir-rx51 uses hrtimers. I thought that
usleep_range() uses hrtimers; however if you're not seeing the same delay
on ir-rx51 then maybe it's time to switch pwm-ir-tx to hrtimers.

I don't have a n900 to test on, unfortunately.

Thanks
