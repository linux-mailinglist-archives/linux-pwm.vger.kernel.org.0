You list two options for something that could be done with the data
above - sending it to DMA or a DSP.  My concern here is that a given
piece of hardware might support more than one option and need to choose
between them.

Something like pre-cooking the commands to read the interrupt status
registers from a device, send a network transfer, or to download
firmware and settings if you power the device off frequently.  Basically
anything with more than one operation that you might want to run
repeatedly and care about the performance of.

Well, it could be pretty much any signal - I'd imagine there will be
things that can trigger off GPIOs for example.  Some sort of timer like
you mention does sound plausible too.  I think the API needs to be
general enough to just cope with a very broad range of things in a
possibly system/device specified manner and not have a short,
prescriptive list.

That sounds reasonable.  If something is software triggered then I'd
expect to integrate with the current queuing mechanism.
