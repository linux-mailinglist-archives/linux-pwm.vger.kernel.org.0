Right, it does not; another misunderstanding on my part. I'll fix the
commit message.

That's right. My thought was to keep the code that enables this clock
close to the code that relies on it, and to minimize the duration the
clock is enabled.

Would it be better to leave the code where it is?

Neither was I, actually, but I guessed the shorter version would be
preferred. I'm happy to change it back to match what you described.
