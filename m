Sorry for not taking a look earlier. Well done on making it this far.

There's a few things that need to be addressed before merging this.

Firstly, the bindings need fixing up. I think these should be the one
file. The device tree bindings are supposed to describe the hardware,
and it doesn't make sense to separate them out just because we plan on
using two subsystems to implement the functionality.

Rob, please chime in if you would prefer something different.

Secondly, we need to clarify why this is a pwm driver and not a hwmon
driver like we had for the 2500 hardware, and that you're planning on
submitting a hwmon driver for the other half of the registers.

Finally, do you really need to use regmap? It's lots of overhead for a
mmio driver, and I like to see it avoided where possible. I know the
regions are shared, but are there any individual registers shared?

Cheers,

Joel
