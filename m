After looking again, I don't understand that part. Note that
pwm_get_state() doesn't call .get_state() at all. Also pwmchip_add()
zero initializes .state, then pwm_get() calls .get_state() (via
pwm_device_request() which is called in .xlate()) which (if the HW is
disabled) doesn't touch .period, so it should continue to be zero?!

So I wonder why your approach 2 works at all. Do you see what I'm
missing?

I looked a bit more into the issue and think that pwm_get_state() isn't
problematic. pwm_get_state() fully assigns *state.

What I don't like about it is that the output of a disabled PWM doesn't
have a period. There might be one configured in hardware(, and the
=2Eget_state() callback might or might not return that), but the emitted
signal has no well-defined period.

If it wants to take over seamlessly, it shouldn't call pwm_apply_state()
at all?!

That really puzzles me because pwm_get_state() fully overwrites state.
