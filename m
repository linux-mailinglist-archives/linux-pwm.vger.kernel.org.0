I've had a deeper look and you're right. Thanks!

Ah, good point, I had not thought of that :)

My only point was that if the period/duty cycle have changed, then the extra
disable may set up the parameters in the pwm hardware correctly (according
to this comment). Uwe has already responded saying this is not going to work,
so this can be ignored.

Again, you're right.

That's the 28 bytes copy I was talking about.

However keeping a pointer in struct pwm_ir is a good compromise and makes
the rest of the code cleaner.

So in order to get everything in order for atomic pwm, we need a few patches
to land. Let's try to get your patch merged for the next release cycle, so
that at least tx on the n900 works and there is improved tx for other devices
(although not the most efficient).
