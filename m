That DTS documentation makes no sense to me, why does what the LED is
wired to matter? Whether you have your transistor next to ground or
next to Vdd doesn=E2=80=99t matter, what matters is whether the =
transistor is
on or off. Maybe what they mean is whether the *PWM's output* / *the
transistor's input* is pulled to ground or Vdd? In which case the
property would indeed not apply here.

Unless that=E2=80=99s written assuming the LED is wired directly to the =
PWM, in
which case it would make sense, but that=E2=80=99s a very narrow-minded =
view of
what the PWM output is (directly) driving.
