Yeah, I think the macro had value about 14 versions ago, but the number
of users has dropped over the revisions.
I think what I am going to to do for the next version is drop that
macro, and only ever hold the registers values in variables.
That had the advantage of making the maths in get_state() better match
the comments that are now quite prevalent in the driver, as the +1s done
there are more obvious.
I'm loathe to link a git tree but, without changes to the period
calculation logic, this is what it looks like w/ a consistent approach
to what period_steps and prescale mean:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/conor/linux.git/tree/driver=
s/pwm/pwm-microchip-core.c?h=3Dpwm-dev-v15
[I blindly pushed that before leaving work & without even building it, so
there's probably some silly mistake in it, but that's besides the point
of displaying variable/comment changes]

So, putting this one aside because it merits more thinking about.
I went through and checked some arbitrary values of tmp, rather than
dealing with "real" ones computed from frequencies I know are easily
available for me to use in the FPGA bitstream I use to test this stuff.

I think my "integer maths" truncation approach is not actually valid.
Consider tmp =3D 255... *prescale gets computed as 255/(254 + 1) =3D 1, per=
 my
algorithm. Then, *period_steps is 255/(1 + 1) - 1 =3D 127.
The period is (1 + 1)(127 + 1), which is not 255.

Or take tmp =3D 510. prescale is 510/(254 + 1) =3D 2. period_steps is then
510/(2 + 1) - 1 =3D 169. period is (2 + 1)(169 + 1), which is 510. The
calculated period is right, but that is not the "optimal" value!

I think you're right in that I do actually need to consider the -1, and
do a ceiling operation, when calculating prescale, IOW:
	*prescale =3D ceil(div_u64(tmp, MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX + 1)) - 1;
	*period_steps =3D div_u64(tmp, *prescale + 1) - 1;
	[I know I can't actually call ceil()]

That'd do the same thing as the truncation where
div_u64(tmp, MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX + 1) is not a round number,
but it improves the round number case, eg tmp =3D 510:
prescale =3D 510/(254 + 1) - 1 =3D 1, period_steps =3D 510/(1 + 1) - 1 =3D =
254
period =3D (1 + 1)(254 + 1) =3D 510

It does mean a zero period would need to be special cased, but I don't
mind that.

scale =3D 5, period_steps =3D 211)

This second one here, where tmp =3D 1275, is a good example of the above.
With the ceil() change, this would be prescale =3D 4, period_steps =3D 254
which I think makes more sense.

With the inconsistency fixed, I think getting the slightly less accurate
period is a byproduct of prioritising the finegrainedness of the duty
cycle.

I want to maintain support for prescale =3D 0, so I'm not really
interested in a computation that forsakes that.

I'll be honest and say that I am getting a bit fatigued with the way
that issues w/ the calculations keep cropping up. I'll put a bit of time
into trying to figure out how to fix the tmp =3D 6400900 case that you
mentioned above, but if it comes out in the wash that that is a facet of
the way this stuff is computed, then I might be inclined to forge ahead
without resolving it... I'd certainly want to explain in a comment
somewhere (limitations section?) the point at which it starts getting
less accurate though. I'll write a script to iterate through the values
of tmp & see if the reason is obvious.

I would like to keep (something resembling) the current simple
implementation of the period calculation, as simplicity is a significant
advantage! I do also like the strategy of trying to maximise the number
of available duty cycle steps, I think it makes perfect sense to make
that the goal.

Thanks again for spending time on this Uwe,
Conor.
