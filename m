Yes, that's what I tried to say. That's regulator_get() and not _optional()
the function that will provide a dummy regulator if isn't physically present:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/regulator/core.c#L2067

So for example when you just use a voltage rail in let's say a board pin header
then you will need to define supply nodes with compatible = "regulator-fixed" ?

That is indeed more accurate from a hardware description point of view but I'm
not convinced that this is something worth to break DT backward compatibility.

You also mentioned (IIUC) that the regulators could be made optional and their
presence be used as an indication that an atomic charge pump configuration can
be made instead of using the current ssd130x->display_settings.use_charge_pump.

I think that would prefer that the latter option, but will let others to chime
in since maybe I'm not correct on the preferred approach.

Great that we are on the same page here.

It's unlikely that drm_panel will get a drm_device since that was the case
but was changed by commit aa6c43644bc5 ("drm/panel: drop drm_device from
drm_panel"). But yes, I agree that we could revisit if there are helpers in
the future to manage a backlight device that is handled by a DRM driver.
