This patch series introduces Rust support for the T-HEAD TH1520 PWM
controller and demonstrates its use for fan control on the Sipeed Lichee
Pi 4A board.

The primary goal of this patch series is to introduce a basic set of
Rust abstractions for the Linux PWM subsystem. As a first user and
practical demonstration of these abstractions, the series also provides
a functional PWM driver for the T-HEAD TH1520 SoC. This allows control
of its PWM channels and ultimately enables temperature controlled fan
support for the Lichee Pi 4A board. This work aims to explore the use of
Rust for PWM drivers and lay a foundation for potential future
Rust based PWM drivers.

The core of this series is a new rust/kernel/pwm.rs module that provides
abstractions for writing PWM chip provider drivers in Rust. This has
been significantly reworked from v1 based on extensive feedback. The key
features of the new abstraction layer include:

 - Ownership and Lifetime Management: The pwm::Chip wrapper is managed
   by ARef, correctly tying its lifetime to its embedded struct device
   reference counter. Chip registration is handled by a pwm::Registration
   RAII guard, which guarantees that pwmchip_add is always paired with
   pwmchip_remove, preventing resource leaks.

 - Modern and Safe API: The PwmOps trait is now based on the modern
   waveform API (round_waveform_tohw, write_waveform, etc.) as recommended
   by the subsystem maintainer. It is generic over a driver's
   hardware specific data structure, moving all unsafe serialization logic
   into the abstraction layer and allowing drivers to be written in 100%
   safe Rust.

 - Ergonomics: The API provides safe, idiomatic wrappers for other PWM
   types (State, Args, Device, etc.) and uses standard kernel error
   handling patterns.

The series is structured as follows:
 - Expose static function pwmchip_release.
 - Rust PWM Abstractions: The new safe abstraction layer.
 - TH1520 PWM Driver: A new Rust driver for the TH1520 SoC, built on
   top of the new abstractions.
 - Device Tree Bindings & Nodes: The remaining patches add the necessary
   DT bindings and nodes for the TH1520 PWM controller, and the PWM fan
   configuration for the Lichee Pi 4A board.

Testing:
Tested on the TH1520 SoC. The fan works correctly. The duty/period
calculations are correct. Fan starts slow when the chip is not hot and
gradually increases the speed when PVT reports higher temperatures.

The patches are based on mainline, with some dependencies which are not
merged yet - platform Io support [1].

Reference repository with all the patches together can be found on
github [2].

Changes in v10:
 - Exported the C pwmchip_release function and called it from the custom
   Rust release_callback to fix a memory leak of the pwm_chip struct.
 - Removed the PwmOps::free callback, as it is not needed for idiomatic
   Rust resource management.
 - Removed the redundant is_null check for drvdata in the release handler,
   as the Rust API guarantees a valid pointer is always provided.

- Link to v9: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250706-rust-next-pwm-working-fan-for-sending-v9-0-42b5ac2101c7@samsung.com

Changes in v9:
 - Encapsulated vtable setup in Chip::new(): The Chip::new() function is
   now generic over the PwmOps implementation. This allows it to create and
   assign the vtable internally, which simplifies the public API by
   removing the ops_vtable parameter from Registration::register().
 - Fixed memory leak with a release handler: A custom release_callback is
   now assigned to the embedded struct device's release hook. This
   guarantees that driver specific data is always freed when the chip is
   destroyed, even if registration fails.
 - The PwmOpsVTable is now defined as a const associated item to ensure
   it has a 'static lifetime.
 - Combined introductory commits: The Device, Chip, and PwmOps abstractions
   are now introduced in a single commit. This was necessary to resolve the
   circular dependencies between them and present a clean, compilable unit
   for review.

- Link to v8: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250704-rust-next-pwm-working-fan-for-sending-v8-0-951e5482c9fd@samsung.com

Changes in v8:
 - Dropped already accepted commit, re-based on top of linux-next
 - Reworked the Chip and PwmOps APIs to address the drvdata() type-safety
   comment. Chip is now generic, and PwmOps uses an associated type
   to provide compile-time guarantees.
 - Added a parent device sanity check to Registration::register().
 - Updated drvdata() to return the idiomatic T::Borrowed<'_>.
 - added temporary unsafe blocks in the driver, as the current
   abstraction for Clk is neiter Safe nor Sync. I think eventually
   proper abstraction for Clk will be added as in a current state it's
   not very useful.

- Link to v7: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250702-rust-next-pwm-working-fan-for-sending-v7-0-67ef39ff1d29@samsung.com

Changes in v7:
- Made parent_device function private and moved casts to Device<Bound>
  there as well.
- Link to v6: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250701-rust-next-pwm-working-fan-for-sending-v6-0-2710932f6f6b@samsung.com

Changes in v6:
 - Re-based on top of linux-next, dropped two already accepted commits.
 - After re-basing the IoMem dependent patchset stopped working,
   reworked it to use similar API like the PCI subsystem (I think it
   will end up the same). Re-worked the driver for it as well.
 - Remove the apply and get_state callbacks, and most of the State as
   well, as the old way of implementing drivers should not be possible
   in Rust. Left only enabled(), since it's useful for my driver.
 - Removed the public set_drvdata() method from pwm::Chip
 - Moved WFHWSIZE to the public include/linux/pwm.h header and renamed it
   to PWM_WFHWSIZE, allowing bindgen to create safe FFI bindings.
 - Corrected the ns_to_cycles integer calculation in the TH1520 driver to
   handle overflow correctly.
 - Updated the Kconfig entry for the TH1520 driver to select the Rust
   abstractions for a better user experience.

- Link to v5: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250623-rust-next-pwm-working-fan-for-sending-v5-0-0ca23747c23e@samsung.com

Changes in v5:
- Reworked `pwm::Chip` creation to take driver data directly, which
  allowed making the `chip.drvdata()` accessor infallible
- added missing `pwm.c` file lost during the commit split (sorry !)
- Link to v4: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250618-rust-next-pwm-working-fan-for-sending-v4-0-a6a28f2b6d8a@samsung.com

Changes in v4:
 - Reworked the pwm::Registration API to use the devres framework,
   addressing lifetime issue.
 - Corrected the PwmOps trait and its callbacks to use immutable references
   (&Chip, &Device) for improved safety.
 - Applied various code style and naming cleanups based on feedback

- Link to v3: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250617-rust-next-pwm-working-fan-for-sending-v3-0-1cca847c6f9f@samsung.com

Changes in v3:
 - Addressed feedback from Uwe by making multiple changes to the TH1520
   driver and the abstraction layer.
 - Split the core PWM abstractions into three focused commits to ease
   review per Benno request.
 - Confirmed the driver now works correctly with CONFIG_PWM_DEBUG enabled
   by implementing the full waveform API, which correctly reads the
   hardware state.
 - Refactored the Rust code to build cleanly with
   CONFIG_RUST_BUILD_ASSERT_ALLOW=n, primarily by using the try_* family of
   functions for IoMem access.
 - Included several cosmetic changes and cleanups to the abstractions
   per Miguel review.

- Link to v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250610-rust-next-pwm-working-fan-for-sending-v2-0-753e2955f110@samsung.com

Changes in v2:
 - Reworked the PWM abstraction layer based on extensive feedback.
 - Replaced initial devm allocation with a proper ARef<Chip> lifetime model
   using AlwaysRefCounted.
 - Implemented a Registration RAII guard to ensure safe chip add/remove.
 - Migrated the PwmOps trait from the legacy .apply callback to the modern
   waveform API.
 - Refactored the TH1520 driver to use the new, safer abstractions.
 - Added a patch to mark essential bus clocks as CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED to fix
   boot hangs when the PWM and thermal sensors are enabled.
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250524-rust-next-pwm-working-fan-for-sending-v1-0-bdd2d5094ff7@samsung.com
