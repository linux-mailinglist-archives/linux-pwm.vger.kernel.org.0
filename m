You only write once to the sync update register (i.e. during probe). So
that register specifies that a period should be completed before a new
setting becomes active, right? Even with sync update this is still racy,
right?

The last paragraph refers to negedge =3D 0, posedge =3D 0 and period_steps =
=3D
0?

The code doesn't match the comment. I think that is a relict from the
times when we thought that a trigger was necessary to update the
operating settings from the shadow registers?

There is no way to query the hardware if there is still an update
pending, right? Maybe that's possible implicitly by memoizing the
expected read value? For me the current approach is fine enough though.
This can be addressed in the future if needed.

Is this racy with sync update implemented in the firmware? A comment
about how the sync update is implemented would be good.

If state->period * clk_rate is 765000000001 you get tmp =3D 765 and then
*prescale =3D 2. However roundup(765000000001 / (1000000000 * 255)) - 1 is
3. The problem here is that you're rounding down in the calculation of
tmp. Of course this is constructed because 765000000001 is prime, but
I'm sure you get the point :-)

Also we know that tmp is < 0xff00, so we don't need a 64 bit division
here.

I don't understand that part. It triggers for tmp =3D 511. So you prefer

	prescale =3D 1
	period_steps =3D 254

yielding period =3D 510 / clkrate over

	prescale =3D 2
	period_steps =3D 170

yielding 513 / clkrate. I wonder why. Alsot tmp =3D 511 is the only value
where this triggers. There is a mistake somewhere (maybe on my side).
