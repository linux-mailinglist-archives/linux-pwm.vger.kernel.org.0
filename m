It's a feature of the controller, but I guess since it may be a per 
fan or tach channel setting having it in the fan node is fine. 
'tach-div' is fine.

Looking back, I see Guenter asked for something like this. So I guess it 
is fine to keep if he still thinks we need it. I think it could also be 
implied a bit more clearly if we do 'cooling-levels' as below. The fan 
controller should know what modes it can do. Duty cycle vs. voltage in 
uV is pretty easy to distinguish.

That should be fine. I guess it comes down to whether we want one 
property or 3 depending on whether the control is voltage, duty-cycle, 
GPIO pins state, etc. Unfortunately, it's "gpio-fan,speed-map", not 
"speed-map", so we can't use that as-is. There's also "cooling-levels" 
which can accomplish the same thing. We don't know RPMs with that, but 
do we need to? Maybe, as it seems some drivers want to set speed in RPMs 
from userspace. Could also do something like this:

cooling-levels = < 33   66  100>;
rpm-levels =     <500 1000 1500>;

"rpm-levels" would replace the min-rpm/max-rpm properties.


Also, looking at gpio-fan.txt, it looks like you should add 
"#cooling-cells" as well.
