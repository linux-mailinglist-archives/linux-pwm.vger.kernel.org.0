Maybe using fsleep() fixes this issue? See commit c6af13d33475 ("timer: add
fsleep for flexible sleeping"), and Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst.

The long wake-up time for an idle state could explain the values. I think
Ivaylo already tested with most cpuidle states disabled via sysfs though.

If you want one for development, the maemo folks cc:ed here likely have
some available devices.
