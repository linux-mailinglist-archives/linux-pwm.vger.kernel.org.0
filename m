Ahh, yeah. That looks like a better idea. I'd much rather be able to
return an actual error.

If get_state() can return an error, there's no need for the question I
think. I'd rather return what's in the shadow registers *and* on the bus
or an error than an inconsistent state.

I'll send a v(N+1) based on the non-void get_state() at some point
soon-ish.

Oh nw about that at all. I feel bad pinging stuff since I know everyone
is busy.
