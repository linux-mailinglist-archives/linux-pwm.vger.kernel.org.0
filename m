No, we talk about MT8183 with mt7986-pwm compatible. Read again my message.

But even your case is not correct. On MT7986 the device would still have
2 channels, how the heck he would get 4? Driver binds to ,t7986-pwm
compatible, which defines 2 channels.

No, that's not correct reason. There would be no wrong MMIO access and
capabilities would be still correctly communicated.

No, it's rather someone did not think about Devicetree compatibles or
did not care to design the Mediatek bindings and just copy-paste
existing pattern...
