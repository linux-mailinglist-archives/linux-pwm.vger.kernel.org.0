You're right, this is also a problematic case that I should've
mentioned here. In fact I *did* have problems with zero written
into the duty cycle register of my clock. I decided that it
should be solved by the hardware driver so I sent a patch
with a zero check there. (As otherwise there might be a clock
that would properly support 0% and 100% cycles so making the
write like this impossible is not a job of this driver I think)

I suppose I should reword the limitation, dropping
the reference to impossible atomic operations and
just state that glitches are inevitable.

Hm, now thinking of it, I'm not sure if the clock line
was set to logic 0 or was left floating (which is what I assume
you mean by the undefined behavior here) on the clock I was
debugging this on with an oscilloscope. (nor am I sure
if I even can make such a conclusion by looking at that...)

Do you think that this should be just documented in the
limitations? Like:

  - Underlying clock may not be able to give 0% or 100%
    duty cycle (constant off or on) and only set the
    closest possible duty cycle. (e.g. 0.1% or 99.9%)
  - When the PWM is disabled, the clock will be disabled
    as well. User should take care of properly pulling 
    the line down in case the disabled clock leaves it
    floating.

(I guess here I'm making an assumption that there is
no clock that will be set to logic 1 upon being disabled
without the way to change that behavior...)

Will move it after the check.

Right, now I see that the core sets those and I force the
#pwm-cells = <2> via the dt bindings. Will drop.

Thanks for the comments! I will send a v3 with the changes
slightly later
