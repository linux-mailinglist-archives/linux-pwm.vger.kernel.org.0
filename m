One more remark/question on this pattern. In __clk_register() there's
the following comment:
/*
* Don't call clk_hw_create_clk() here because that would pin the
* provider module to itself and prevent it from ever being removed.
*/
I think we have the same situation here when calling devm_clk_hw_register()
and devm_clk_hw_get_clk() both from pwm-meson. So we may not be able to
remove module pwm-meson. Shouldn't be really relevant for us because we
need pwm for the CPU voltage regulator and therefore have it built-in.
But it wouldn't be nice.
