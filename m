Hi Thierry,

Thank you for organizing and providing guidance on this patch series.
I'd like to
confirm my understanding of the next steps. Based on the previous discussio=
ns,
I should proceed by combining the PWM and TACH drivers into a single driver=
.
This consolidated driver would then be exposed to both the hwmon and
pwm subsystems.
Base on this driver the dts node of this would like following:

pwm_tach: pwm-tach-controller@1e610000 {
compatible =3D "aspeed,ast2600-pwm-tach"
reg =3D <0x1e610000 0x100>;
clocks =3D <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_AHB>;
resets =3D <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_PWM>;
#pwm-cells =3D <3>;
#address-cells =3D <1>;
#size-cells =3D <0>;
fan@0 {
aspeed,fan-tach-ch =3D /bits/ 8 <0x00>;
};
fan@1 {
aspeed,fan-tach-ch =3D /bits/ 8 <0x01, 0x02>;
};
};

The subnode of the fan is utilized to create the hwmon interface,
which facilitates monitoring
the speed of the input tach pin.
If users wish to employ PWM for fan or beeper control, they can create
the necessary configuration
through the following DTS declaration:
fan0: pwm-fan0 {
compatible =3D "pwm-fan";
pwms =3D <&pwm_tach 0 40000 0>; /* Target freq:25 kHz */
cooling-min-state =3D <0>;
cooling-max-state =3D <3>;
#cooling-cells =3D <2>;
cooling-levels =3D <0 15 128 255>;
};

buzzer {
compatible =3D "pwm-beeper";
pwms =3D <&pwm_tach 1 500000 0>;
};

Thanks
Best Regards,
Billy Tsai
