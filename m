I don't mind it put to sound/*.  But, note that pcsp.c you pointed in
the above is a PCM tone generator driver with a PC beep device, and it
provides the normal SND_BEEP input only for compatibility.

Indeed there have been already many sound drivers providing the beep
capability, and they bind with the input device using SND_BEEP.  And,
for the beep volume, "Beep Playback Volume" mixer control is provided,
too.
