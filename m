I threw together a python script to go through the various values of tmp
& check which ones ended up with these "non-optimal" prescale values.
For tmp < 1000, I saw:
tmp: 511 | 255 - period_steps: 86
tmp: 766 | 255 - period_steps: 65
tmp: 767 | 255 - period_steps: 65
That then grows as tmp moves upwards, so:
tmp: 1021  | 255 - period_steps: 52
tmp: 1022  | 255 - period_steps: 52
tmp: 1023  | 255 - period_steps: 52

That looks oddly like (tmp % (254 + 1)) < prescale and seems to be an
"artifact" of using 254 to calculate the prescaler rather than 255.
I think that that can be worked around while keeping the current simple
approach to calculating prescale/period_steps. Looks like 32385 out of
the 65280 valid values for tmp can benefit! That's in comparison to the
127 that would produce the invalid period_steps value of 255.

I'll go submit something fixing this next week then I suppose.
