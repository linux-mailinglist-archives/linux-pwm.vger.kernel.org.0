I would not bet on this. Maybe in such a case clk_set_duty_cycle might
also fail. The clk API isn't (TTBOMK) well-defined enough to make
promises like that.

This isn't universally true. I'd expect that just freezing (i.e. driving
either high or low depending on the state when the clk was stopped) is a
very usual behaviour. So a pull isn't always a good idea.

I would just keep that unspecified.
