I don't understand what you wanna say here. If tmp =3D 256 my suggestion
is to pick prescale =3D 0 and period_steps =3D 254. Then

	 (prescale + 1) * (period_steps + 1) =E2=89=A4 tmp

and period_steps is big enough to ensure a a finegrained choice for the
duty_cycle.

I think you mean s/prescale/period_steps/ in the second part, but that's
not what I meant. I meant to suggest:

	*prescale =3D tmp / (MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX + 1) - 1
	period_steps =3D MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX =3D 254

That would be an explanation, yes. :-)
