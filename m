Hey Uwe, all,

Added some extra patches so I have a cover letter this time.
You pointed out that I was overriding npwmcells in the driver and I 
realised that the dt & binding were not correct so I have added two
simple patches to deal with that. The dts patch I will take in my tree
once the binding is applied.

For the maintainers entry, I mentioned before that I have several
changes in-flight for it. We are late(ish) in the cycle so I doubt
you'll be applying this for v5.20, but in the off chance you do - I
would be happy to send it (with your Ack) alongside an i2c addition
that is "deferred".

In your review of v3, you had a lot of comments about the period and
duty cycle calculations, so I have had another run at them. I converted
the period calculation to "search" from the bottom up for the suitable
prescale value. The duty cycle calculation has been fixed - the problem
was exactly what I suspected in my replies to your review. I had to block
the use of a 0xFF period_steps register value (which I think should be
covered by the updated comment and limitation #2).

Beyond that, I have rebased on -next and converted to the devm_ stuff
in probe that was recently added & dropped remove() - as requested.
I added locking to protect the period racing, changed the #defines and
switched to returning -EINVAL when the period is locked to a value
greater than that requested.

Thanks,
Conor.
