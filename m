I wasn't talking about the sl28cpld btw. What is the difference between
your proposed "change take place immediately" and "after the cycle".
I understand how the after the cycle should work. But how would the
immediate change work in your ideal PWM?

That is correct.

This would actually work. I could imagine that comparing "less than" 
will
take up more space again. But it would be worth a try; see also below.

Disabling it has some side effects like switching to another function
for this multi function pin. So I'd rather keep it on ;)

Little bit here a little bit there ;) TBH there are some more critical
bugs which would need to be fixed first. So this would need to be a
limitation for now.
