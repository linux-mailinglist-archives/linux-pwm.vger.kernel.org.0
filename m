Short stop has side effects especially in the case where 1PPS is generated using
this PWM. In this case where PWM period is continuously synced with PTP clock,
cannot expect any breaks in PWM. This doesn't fall in the above limitations as
well. as duty_cycle is not a worry and only the rising edge is all that matters.

Also any specific reason why you wanted to stop rather than having the mentioned
limitation? it is just a corner anyway and doesn't happen all the time.

Thanks and regards,
Lokesh
