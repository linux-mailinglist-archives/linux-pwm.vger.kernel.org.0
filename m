As mentioned in v10 that seems like a great idea, as long as we can
carefully validate and communicate these numbers to the user; both
through documentation and kernel error messages when values are
ultimately rejected.

Again, perhaps it might be better to postpone this to a separate
patchset as to not block the use of LPG for backlights which is arguably
more important than some fancy phone notification led patterns.

Yes, 9 bits in total and BIT(8) being the highest settable ^^
