A series with (up to now) 13 revisions and long delays between the
review rounds (which are mostly attributed to my time schedule) is
difficult to handle on both sides. Some repetition isn't easy to prevent
in such a case. Sorry for that.=20

My variant is a bit longer and uses more variables, but has less
repetition. I don't expect a relevant change on the generated code. I
slightly prefer my variant, but I let you choose which one you prefer.

Well, the calculation lands in the right ballpark for sure, but if my
intuition is right, it's not as exact as it could be. I need some time
with pencil and paper ...

I'm not aware of such a lecture. I'm willing to take the blame for some
of the revisions because I'm very picky and the math involved here isn't
trivial. And I sometimes wonder about myself pointing out an issue in
(say) v5 which was there unnoticed already in v1.

In sum a patch series going through such a high number of revisions is
mostly a good sign. In the end we can be sure that the merged code is
checked deep-rootedly and that both you and me have a certain amount of
endurance. :-)

Best regards
Uwe
