FTR: The only problems I have with mail sending in this thread is to
"devicetree@vger.kernel.or", I added a 'g' for this mail to that address
:-) Otherwise if you diagnose to have problems with the pengutronix
server accepting your mail, I'd like to hear about that.

Pass --base with a sensible parameter to git-format-patch (or
git-send-email) to make the 0day bots happy.

It's not me who merges PWM patches but Thierry. I don't know his plans
and if he would be willing to pick up a new driver for the next cycle.
You might still get lucky with a fast next iteration.

If you want ignore the devm_clk_get_prepared() suggestion, we can still
convert to that once both patches hit Linus Torvald's tree.

I think the driver looks good otherwise, so I don't expect to have more
feedback in the next round.
