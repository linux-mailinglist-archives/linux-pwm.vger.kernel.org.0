Maybe this is my naivity talking, but I'd rather wait. Is there not the
chance that we re-enter pwm_apply() before the update has actually gone
through?
IIRC, but I'll have to confirm it, when the "shadow registers" are
enabled reads show the values that the hardware is using rather than the
values that are queued in the shadow registers. I'd rather avoid that
sort of mess and always sleep.

Now that I think of it, the reason I moved to unconditionally sleeping
was that if I turned on the PWM debugging it'd get tripped up. When it
tried to read the state, it got the old one rather than what'd just been
written.

Pasting my comment from above:

By "bus" in this statement, I meant on the AXI/AHB etc bus that the IP
core is connected to the CPUs on rather than the output. Perhaps my
wording of the comment could be improved and replace the word "bus" with
some wording containing "CPU" instead. "The updated values will not
appear to the CPU until" maybe.

I can also add some words relating to unconditionally sleeping w.r.t to
disabled states.

Not entirely sure by what you mean: "waits on such a completion".
The hardware updates the registers at the first end-of-period after
SYNC_UPD is set. Don't write the bit, nothing happens. From the docs:

The docs also say:

The second statement is at best vague (if the this bit in "when this
bit" refers to the bit in SHADOW_REG_EN) or contradictory at worse.
I suspect it's the former meaning, as shadow registers are a per-channel
thing. I suppose I have to go get some docs changed, **sigh**. It
doesn't make all that much sense to me, SHADOW_REG_EN is a RTL parameter
not a register that can be accessed from the AXI interface.

Anyways, back to the topic at hand.. if you were to do the following
(in really pseudocode form..):
	write(SYNC_UPD)
	write(period)
	<end-of-period>
	write(duty)

Then the duty cycle would not get updated, ever. At least, per doc
comment #1 & my "experimental" data. The RTL is rather dumb, since
AFAICT, this is meant to be cheap to implement in FPGA fabric.
Hence the default core configuration option is no shadow registers
& just immediately updates the output, waveform glitches be damned.

Hopefully that all helps?

Fallout from refactoring I assume. I'll drop it.

Yeah, should be current_state. Thanks.
