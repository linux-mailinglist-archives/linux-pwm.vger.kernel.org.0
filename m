I find this a bit confusing due to the 1-based register numbering. For
example, 0x30 is not one of the CCR registers at all.
When TIM_CCR(i) is used in the code, it's not evident that the valid
range is 1...4.

I'd prefer to leave this as is ...

... and just turn this into

	regmap_read(regmap, TIM_CCR1 + 4 * ch, value);

I think it is not necessary.

ch is set to pwm->hwpwm, which is < pwm->npwm, which is <= 4.

I'd like to drop read/write_ccrx altogether and replace them with a
single regmap_read/write.

Again this feels like an unnecessary indirection to me. I think it
doesn't work like this either, the mask has to be a compile time
constant.

There's already a few examples of the (TIM_CCER_CC1E << (ch * 4))
pattern in the driver. If they must be converted to something else, I'd
prefer this to be done separately, for all of them.

Yes, thanks.

In practice this can't happen because PSC, ARR, and CCRx fields are
only 16-bit.
Although I'm not sure whether this will be true for future designs.

What to do about this, "prd = max(1, div);"?
This should probably be fixed separately.

I'll lock priv->lock in get_state.

This should be fixed separately as well.

Yes, I'll do that.

I can't properly read "nenabled", I'll turn it into "num_enabled"
(there's precedence with "priv->num_breakinputs") and drop "npwm"
altogether, as the value can be returned directly.
