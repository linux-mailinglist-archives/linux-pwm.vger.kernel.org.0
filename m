Hallo Miquel,

No, that's not what I meant. Your hardware seems to have two different
"modes". One where you can set the intensity between 0 and 15/16, and
another where the intensity is between 1/16 and 16/16, right? Switching
between these two results in a glitch and you use the first mode only
for intensity 0 and the second for the rest. If now you have to go from
0 to 8/16 your driver does a mode switch while this isn't necessary.

I also wonder if a glitch can at least be made less likely, even when
going from 0% to 100%. You claimed that changing intensity was glitch
free (i.e. the currently running period is completed before the changed
setting has an effect). Does this hold also for changing the blink
phase?

It's the consumer who is supposed to stop the PWM before freeing it.
Then better do the oscillator stop when pwm_apply_state(pwm, {...
.enabled = false }) is called (and the other PWMs are off, too).

Yes, I understood that the period is fixed for your PWM. However
consider a consumer who would prefer a different period. If you decline
all requests unless state->period == PWM_PERIOD_NS the consumer has no
guide to determine that unless all periods are tested. If however asking
for period = 2s results in getting 31.25 ms this allows the consumer to
assume that no period setting between 2s and 31.25 ms is possible. And
so the usual policy to implement is as stated in my previous mail.

(Of course for we'd need something like pwm_round_state() to effectively
find a good request without actually modifying the hardware state. That
is on my todo list.)

I interpret that as a "yes". IMHO it's a misconcept that a PWM driver
has to remember the duty cycle (and period) with enabled=false even
though this has no influence on the actual output in that state. I'd
like to get rid of .enabled in struct pwm_state completely, but Thierry
doesn't agree.

When we'd get rid of struct pwm_state::enabled this would be clearer,
right? As this driver will be another instance that will hopefully help
me convincing Thierry in the end, can you please add a comment somewhere
at the top like this?:

/*
 * Limitations:
 * - Period fixed to 31.25 ms
 * - Only supports normal polarity
 * - Doesn't support a disabled state
 * - Some glitches cannot be prevented
 */

(The idea is that a command like

	for f in drivers/pwm/pwm-*.c ; do echo $f; sed -rn '/^ \* Limitation/,/^ \*\/?$/p' $f ; done

gives some nice overview about common limitations.)

But also today you should check the hardware state and if duty_cycle is
greater than 0 don't report the PWM as disabled.

Best regards
Uwe
