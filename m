I probably started hacking on the example you gave and didn't notice
the U. What I have here is ~what you suggested last time.

That'd be fsleep(delay_us), but does at least clean up some of the
messing.

Despite having used them, I dislike ternary statements.

We did discuss it previously AFAICT;
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pwm/896d73ac-05af-8673-8379-29011800be83@micr=
ochip.com/

In that version of the code, prescale_val meant the mathematical value
used for calculations & "prescale" was the value written into the
register.

Now, we have ditched prescale_val and operate directly with what gets
written into the register.

I ran a test case through the calculation, and it seemed to work out?

Say period =3D 2000 ns, clk_rate =3D 62.5 Mhz, giving a register value for
prescale of 0.49019...=20

> 	                     period * clk_rate

Same numbers, but we use the PREG_TO_VAL() macro so the mathematical value
is 1.49019.

     2000 * 62.5E6
--------------------- - 1 =3D 82.88360....
  1E9 * (0.49016 + 1)

(0.49016 + 1) * (82.88360 + 1)      124.99...
------------------------------ =3D ------------- =3D 0.00000199999
            62.5E6                  62.5E6

And then accounting for that fact that 2000 was really 2000E-9,
we arrive back where we started, give or take some rounding?

Doing that with integer maths works out more cleanly since 0.49016
becomes 0.
   2000 * 62.5E6
------------------ - 1 =3D 124
  1E9 * (0 + 1)

(0 + 1) * (124 + 1)      125
------------------- =3D --------- =3D 0.000002
      62.5E6            62.5E6

Unfortunately, I don't think I am seeing what you're seeing.

>     period * clk_rate                period * clk_rate
>   (------------------- + 1) * (-----------------------------) / clk_rate
>    NSEC_PER_SEC * 0xff         NSEC_PER_SEC * (prescale + 1)
                          ^
It may be this + 1, which I don't seem to have accounted for in my quick
run through a calculation?

*prescale =3D div_u64(tmp, MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD_STEPS_MAX);

*period_steps =3D div_u64(tmp, PREG_TO_VAL(*prescale)) - 1;

The code does not add a 1 when it calculates prescale, only when it uses
the result to calculate period_steps, since prescale & period_steps are
the register values, not the "mathematical" ones.

Hopefully I've not gone and made a fool of myself...

Makes sense, woops. I think I've revised this to the point that my
blinkers have turned on & I'll wait a while before resubmitting in order
to hopefully reset that.

Perhaps I need to watch a lecture on how to write a PWM driver since I
am clearly no good at it, given the 15 revisions. Do you know of any?

Thanks,
Conor.
