So on a raspberry pi (model 3b), if I use the pwm-ir-tx driver, I get random
delays of up to 100us. It's a bit random and certainly depends on the load.

I'm measuring using a logic analyzer.

There have been reports by others on different machines with random delays
and/or transmit failures (as in the receiver occassionally fails to decode
the IR). I usually suggest they use the gpio-ir-tx driver, which does work
as far as I know (the signal looks perfect with a logic analyzer).

So far I've taken the view that the driver works ok for most situations,
since IR is usually fine with upto 100us missing here or there.

The gpio-ir-tx driver works much better because it does the entire send 
under spinlock - obviously that has its own problems, because an IR transmit
can be 10s or even 100s of milliseconds.

I've never known of a solution to the pwm-ir-tx driver. If using hrtimers
directly improves the situation even a bit, then that would be great.

If we can switch pwm-ir-tx to hrtimers, that would be great.

The ir-rx51 removal patches have already been queued to media_staging;
we may have to remove them from there if we can't solve this problem.

That would be fantastic. Please do keep us up to date with how you are
getting on. Like I said, it would be nice to this resolved before the next
merge window.
