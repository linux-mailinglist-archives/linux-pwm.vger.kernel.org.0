One dumb question that I still have is: besides any backward
compatibility aspects, do we really care about the period/frequency of
the PWM? Why do we enforce a period and an active duration, while
we could limit ourselves to a ratio and let the driver use the most
suitable frequency if the hardware supports it?


This is purely a theoretical question, I am not requesting any API
changes.
