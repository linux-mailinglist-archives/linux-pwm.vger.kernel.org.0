This statement does not apply in general. There are plenty of drivers
which cannot reasonably build for 32-bit, and make no sense because no
32-bit hardware exists that could use them. Examples include anything
that accesses 64-bit registers on 64-bit SoCs the normal way, and
further anything that touches CPU stuff like system registers.

In *this* case, if the only issue is some 64-bit math, then yes, it
should be made to build on 32-bit (especially since this is likely to
also work for older 32-bit Apple SoCs). But the (COMPILE_TEST && 64BIT)
pattern is definitely valid in other cases, and I've been adding it
lately to shut up the kernel test bot since it makes no sense to compile
test a whole pile of our drivers on 32-bit architectures - they
fundamentally can't compile without adding pointless hypothetical broken
fluff to the driver like split MMIO accesses (which often can't work on
real hardware), and it serves no purpose.
