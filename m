To throw in my green for our bike shed: I'd pick

	pwm_apply_state_cansleep()

to match what gpio does (with gpiod_set_value_cansleep()). (Though I
have to admit that semantically Thierry's might_sleep is nicer as it
matches might_sleep().)

If we don't want to have an explicit indicator for the atomic/fast
variant (again similar to the gpio framework), maybe we can drop
"_state" which I think is somehow redundant and go for:

	pwm_apply (fast)
	pwm_apply_cansleep (sleeping)
	pwm_apply_state (compat alias for pwm_apply_cansleep())

(maybe replace cansleep with might_sleep). Similar for pwm_get_state()
we could use the opportunity and make

	pwm_get()

actually call ->get_state() and introduce

	pwm_get_lastapplied()

with the semantic of todays pwm_get_state(). Do we need a
pwm_get_cansleep/might_sleep()?

Best regards
Uwe
