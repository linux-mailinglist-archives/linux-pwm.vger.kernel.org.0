Yes, here the reference for the former approach:
Chapter 2 "Charge Pump Regulator" on Page 62 of the SSD1306 datasheet:
https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf

Just a TL;DR of the former approach for easier discussion:
The logic supply VDD would always be mandatory.
The low voltage supply VBAT would be optional and probed first.
If found, it would supersede the "high" voltage driving supply VCC and
the charge pump would be enabled. If VBAT is not found, then VCC is
mandatory and the charge pump will not be enabled.
