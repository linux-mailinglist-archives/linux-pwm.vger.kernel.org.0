Hey Uwe!

Was nice to meet you at FOSDEM, if I'd seen that presentation before
working on this driver I think the version count would have been
substantially lower!

So my "plan" I guess is to rebase this on v6.3-rc1 & re-submit with the
various minor bits fixed.
Trying the proposed "fixes" to the period calculation that we had
discussed pointed out the above issue, and it appears, to me at least,
that we made a mess of translating from regular calculations to integer
ones.

Cheers,
Conor.
