It's not "dangerous" at all, as the macro will enforce type-safety, you
can't get it wrong when using it.

Ideally this is best as a macro as it's just doing pointer math, worst
case, the compiler turns a function like this into a real function and
you have a call/subtract/return for every time you make this call.

So this conversion to functions feels odd to me, as you potentially are
making all of this worse overall.

Wait until people realize that when we eventually turn these into
container_of_const() you HAVE to go back to using it as a macro instead
of in a function call wrapper like this...
