Correct.

The PWM capability is discoverable by the looking for it in the pin
control IP MMIO, it's not a separate device, but a sibling (child?)
of the pin control, that's not a separate entity.

Moreover, not every pin control _community_ has that capability (capabilities
are on the Community level and depends on ACPI representation of the
communities themself - single device or device per community - the PWM may or
may not be easily attached.

What you are proposing is to invent at least two additional properties or so
for the pin control device description and then to support old platforms,
create a board file somewhere else, which will go through all pin control
devices, checks the capabilities, then embeds the properties via properties
(Either embedded into DSDT, if done in BIOS, or swnodes).

Do I get you right?

If so, in my opinion it's way more ugly and overkill that the current
approach.

Right.

It's a dynamic feature and existing firmwares are carved in stone.
It might be possible to move the above mentioned uglification to
the BIOS. But the horizon of that is 5+ years in case I am able
to convince program managers for it (TBH, I don't believe it's
feasible, since "Windows works!" mantra, they are not engineers).

That said, I agree that this looks not nice, but that's all what
Mika and me can come up with to make all this as little ugly and
intrusive as possible.
