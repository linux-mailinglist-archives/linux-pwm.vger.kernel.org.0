Subject: [PATCH] pwm: imx27: fix overflow for bigger periods
Date:   Mon,  7 Dec 2020 15:13:24 +0100

The second parameter of do_div is an u32 and NSEC_PER_SEC * prescale
overflows this for bigger periods. Assuming the usual pwm input clk rate
of 66 MHz this happens starting at requested period > 606060 ns.

Splitting the division into two operations doesn't loose any precision.
It doesn't need to be feared that c / NSEC_PER_SEC doesn't fit into the
unsigned long variable "duty_cycles" because in this case the assignment
above to period_cycles would already have been overflowing as
period >= duty_cycle and then the calculation is moot anyhow.

Hello,

for a similar patch I said "that looses more precision than I thought at
first", but I think this was wrong. And if it looses precision the same
applies to the calculation of period_cycles which uses the same
operations.

I'm a bit at doubt how urgent this patch is. The regression was
introduced in 5.8-rc1.

Best regards
Uwe
