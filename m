Visual inspection seems to confirm those numbers indeed!

Doesn't that 512ms limit, together with using only the last value for
hi_pause (and not the first value for lo_pause) force users to write
patterns in a certain way which is not easily conveyed to the caller
except by reading the comment in the driver?  I'd guess lo_pause can be
used even if not in ping-pong mode, it should just hold at the first
value for the given duration?

(That said hw_pattern is anyway already riddled with device-specific
information, such as only having one `delta_t` which functions as the
step size for every entry, and with the change above would need to be
sourced from another step that's not the first.)

Bit of a stretch, but perhaps worth noting anyway: should this be
written in documentation somewhere, together with pattern examples and
their desired outcome to function as testcases too?
