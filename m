Thanks for reviewing! Yes, it does feel like a crazy workaround. I'm not
super proud of it. The best documentation I've been able to look at is
the PXA168 software manual [1]. Page 502 of the PDF talks about a
"graceful shutdown" where turning off the clock enable bit doesn't
immediately stop the clock, and instead it waits for the current PWM
period to complete first. This driver is currently configuring it for
graceful shutdown mode, because the PWMCR_SD bit is not set (page 1257).

I've experimentally determined that if you try to turn the clock back on
when a graceful shutdown is still scheduled, it doesn't cancel the
graceful shutdown, so the clock ends up off afterward, even though the
common clock framework thinks it's still on. The hacky delay in this
commit works around that problem. This almost seems like a problem that
should be solved on the common clock framework side instead, but it
doesn't know what the PWM frequency is so it wouldn't know how long to
delay.

Do all the other similar drivers in the kernel do a graceful shutdown
like this when they are turned off? If not, a simpler solution would be
to start turning on the PWMCR_SD bit instead, so the clock stops
immediately (potentially resulting in the final duty cycle being short).
I tested that change in place of this commit and it seems to work pretty
well, although I can still cause it to fail if I turn my PWM backlight
off and back on quickly without a "sleep 0.000001" in between. It feels
to me like there are some weird interdependencies between the clock
enable bits and the actual PWM controller block, at least in the PXA168,
likely due to "graceful shutdown" mode's existence.

What do you think? Turning on the PWMCR_SD bit would be very simple, but
it doesn't fully fix the issue in my testing. I'd still be okay with it
though, because the only failure case I can reproduce is a minor edge
case (plus, I don't love the delay solution).

My bad, thanks for pointing this out. If this comment still exists in
the next version of the patch, I'll fix it.

Thanks,
Doug
