Can I have your input on this proposal?

On one hand I agree that the GPIO driver is already quite big due to
its genericity and the amount of controllers it supports, on the other
hand:
1/ Registering a PWM driver from the GPIO core seems strange. Maybe
registering a platform device could do the trick but I am not convinced
it is worth the trouble.
2/ Putting the PWM logic in the drivers/pwm/ directory is not very
convenient as the object file will have to be embedded within the GPIO
one; this line in drivers/gpio/Makefile would be horrible:
... += gpio-pca953x.o ../pwm/pwm-max7313.o (not even sure it works)
3/ In any cases, the regmap's ->readable_reg(), ->writable_reg()
callbacks shall be tweaked to turn the PWM registers accessible, so we
would still have PWM related code in the PCA953x GPIO driver.

In the end, I wonder if keeping everything in one file is not better?
Eventually I can create a separate file and fill it with just the PWM
helpers/hooks. Please advise on the better solution for you, I'll wait
your feedback before addressing Thierry Reding's other review and
resubmit.


Thanks,
