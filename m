Hi Uwe,

I do agree that with such a two-step process the reverting (should the
need arise) would be much cheaper. I tried out your suggestion and saw
that this is not possible as the patch stands currently due to
compilation warning and errors that arise for various architectures:

warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
warning: right shift count >= width of type [-Wshift-count-overflow]
error: passing argument 1 of '__div64_32' from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]
note: expected 'uint64_t *' {aka 'long long unsigned int *'} but argument is of type 'unsigned int *'
warning: format '%llu' expects argument of type 'long long unsigned int', but argument 4 has type 'unsigned int' [-Wformat=]

Could you please indicate how we should proceed further?

Noted, will make this change.

Sure, will make a note of this in the commit log. In short, one is used
when only the numerator is 64-bit while the other is meant for the case
when both numerator and denominator are 64-bit.

Thank you.

Guru Das.
