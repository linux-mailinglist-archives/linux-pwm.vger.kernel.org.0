Yes this is needed especially in the use-case[0] that I am trying to enable
using PWM. In this case PWM cannot be stopped in between and needs to be updated
dynamically. Also hardware doesn't provide any restrictions on updating the
period. So IMHO, this might be the right thing to do.

Tony did provide tested-by and I measured PWM signals on scope with these
changes. Let me know if any thing else is required?
