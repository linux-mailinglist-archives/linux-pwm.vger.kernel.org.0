Oh I see how the misunderstanding came; I didn't mean the PCM
implementation like pcsp driver.  The pcsp driver is a real hack and
it's there just for fun, not for any real practical use.  
What I meant was rather that you can create a sound device containing
a mixer volume control that serves exactly like the sysfs or whatever
other interface, without any PCM stream or other interface.

Hmm, how can it be racy if you do proper locking?

Those are "extensions" I have mentioned, and I'm not a big fan for
that, honestly speaking.

The fact that the beep *output* stuff is provided by the *input*
device is already confusing (it was so just because of historical
reason), and yet you start implementing more full-featured mixer
control.  I'd rather keep fingers away.

Again, if user-space requires the compatible behavior like the
existing desktop usages, it can be implemented in a similar way like
the existing ones; i.e. provide a mixer control with a proper sound
device.  The sound device doesn't need to provide a PCM interface but
just with a mixer interface.

Or, if the purpose of your target device is a special usage, you don't
need to consider too much about the existing interface, and try to
keep the change as minimal as possible without too intrusive API
changes.
