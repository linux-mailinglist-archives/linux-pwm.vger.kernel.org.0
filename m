No, the thing I'm concerned about is assuming MCHPCOREPWM_PRESCALE and
MCHPCOREPWM_PERIOD correspond to state->period. So I'd drop the last
block use the 2nd last instead without further condition.

exiting early is fine.

Even 255 * 255 * 1000000000 overflows. With a maintainer's hat on, it is
very valuable to prevent such issues because your driver might be used
as a template for the next driver.

I don't understood that.
