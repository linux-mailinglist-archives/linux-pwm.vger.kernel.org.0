It is single chip. It should be a single hardware monitoring device with
16 channels. I don't even want to think about the mess we'd get if people
start modeling a single chip as N hardware monitoring devices, one for
each monitoring channel supported by that chip. It would be even more messy
if the driver supporting those N devices would be marked for asynchronous
probe, which would result in random hwmon device assignments.

I am fine either way as well, as long as we are talking about a single
hwmon device and not 16 of them.
