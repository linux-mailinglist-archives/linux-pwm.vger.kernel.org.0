Sure.

Good point.

I have to agree here. "can" is shorter and clearer than "might", since
"can" expresses capability. Having said that the mixture of nomenclature is
not great, so there is very little between them.

This is very nice. :) There are callsites in 15 files, might as well rename
it and do away with pwm_apply_state()

Not all drivers implement .get_state(), how would we handle those?
