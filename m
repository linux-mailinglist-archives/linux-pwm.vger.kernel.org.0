Yeah & I did think of something along these lines. I was torn between
something that seemed heavy handed (timers) and calculating if enough
time had elapsed, which seemed a bit hacky.

Figured I was better off doing something quickly & asking rather than
polishing only to find out it was disliked ;)

Prefer to wait in get_state() or in both it & apply()?
Depending on how far away updatetimestamp is, would we still not want to
time out if it is going to be a long time, no?

Thanks again Uwe,
