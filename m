Please fix your line wrapping, not sure what's going on here, but these
lines are super long.

You should be getting a reference to the clock and calling enable on it
etc, even if the LVDSC is also doing so. That will allow the clock
framework to correctly track users.

The binding describes the hardware, so yes it should be there. What the
driver implementation does with the clock is not relevant. That said, I
think the driver should actually be using it, as I wrote above.

This looks correct, but the comment is not needed. Setting minItems: 3
does this for you.

I'll take your word for it :)

Whatever node corresponds to the register range controlling this PLL
should be a "clock-controller" (like any other clock provider does).
Your PMC should have this property. I don't know if the correct location
is the mfd node or somewhere else, you'll have to check your docs.

Thanks,
Conor.
