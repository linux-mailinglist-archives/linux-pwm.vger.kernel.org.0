There is a corner case where period/duty-cycle gets updated in the middle of the
cycle. So let me give more details on how it works:

OMAP dual-mode timers with a upward  timer counter, can be configured in PWM
mode. When the timer counter overflows it gets reloaded with the load value(Load
register) and the pwm output goes up. When counter matches with match register,
the output goes down. So the load register is used to calculate the period and
similarly match register for duty cycle.

When PWM is running and changing both duty cycle and period, we cannot prevent
in software that the output might produce a period with mixed settings.
Especially when the PWM signal is high the following cases can happen:
1) When signal is high and new match value is > current timer counter. Then the
duty cycle gets reflected in the current cycle.(Duty_cycle for current period=
new match value -  previous load  value).
2) When signal is high and new match value is < current timer counter. Then the
period and duty cycle for the current cycle gets effected as well. Because the
signal is pulled down only when counter matches with match register, and this
happens only in the next cycle(after timer counter overflows). Then:
	- new Period for current cycle = (current period + new period)
	- new duty cycle for current cycle =  (current period + new duty_cycle).

Rest all the cases the values gets reflected in the next cycle.

As advised by Uwe, I have updated all these details in driver.

Thanks and regards,
Lokesh
