Yes, but I'd see another 2 channels which do not work, accessing them
may even cause problems (I haven't tried that) as it means accessing
an undocumented memory range of the SoC which we in general we
shouldn't be messing around with.

Also note that this case is the same as MT8183 vs. MT8365, they got
distinct compatible strings and also for those two the only difference
is the number of channels.

By that definition you should remove the additional compatible for
MT8365 or rather, it should have been rejected for the same argument.

I'm talking about
commit fe00faee8060402a3d85aed95775e16838a6dad2
commit 394b517585da9fbb2eea2f2103ff47d37321e976
