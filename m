So, if the period isn't locked always re-configure it. Makes life easier
for me.

On startup, (negedge == posedge) is true as both are zero, but the reset
values for prescale and period are actually 0x8. If on reset I try to
set a small period, say "echo 1000 > period" apply() returns -EINVAL
because of a check in the pwm core in pwm_apply_state() as I am
attempting to set the period to lower than the out-of-reset duty cycle.

I considered zeroing the registers, but if something below Linux had
been using the PWM I felt that may not be the right thing to do. Can I
continue to check for the enablement here or would you rather I did
something different?

Thanks,
Conor.
