Happy to change this of course. I changed it and then changed it back after
Uwe's comment, I'll fix this in the next version.

One tiny advantage is that pwm_ops is static const while pwm_chip is
allocated per-pwm, so will need instructions for setting the value. Having
said that, the difference is tiny, it's a single bool.
