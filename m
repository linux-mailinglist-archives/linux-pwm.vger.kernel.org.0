You broke U-Boot now as well - it will get your new DTS from the kernel
and stop working.

OK, that explains the reasons. I read your commit msg and nothing like
this was mentioned there. What's more, you did not deprecate the old
binding, thus the confusion - it looked like you add entirely new
hardware (although you put "deprecated" but in some unrelated place, not
next to the compatibles).

Anyway, the main point of Neil was that you started using generic
compatible for all SoCs, which is wrong as well. I guess this was the
original discussion.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
