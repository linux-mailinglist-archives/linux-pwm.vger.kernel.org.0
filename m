The main time required for the header inclusion is mmap():ing it (that's what
I believe preprocessor does) and parsing. In any case, testing on a high-speed
machine one file case is not correct (scientific) approach. Of course with
your measurements will be in the error range.

As I have learnt at university the very first question for the experiment
we should ask ourselves is "what exactly have we measured?"

I'm not sure any continuation of this makes sense if we haven't answered
to this. When I measured preprocessor speed up (not in this case, though),
I used ccache tool, because it makes more clear the time spend for C
preprocessor (by caching the compiler results), so 10 runs of that maybe
closer to the real world (hot cache which should have no effect on the
iteration-to-iteration time).

That said, if you want to NAK this, please do it explicitly. I'm not going
to waste my time on this simple change anymore.

I agree on this. But I expect a NAK, so simplest to me is to drop this patch
from the series.
