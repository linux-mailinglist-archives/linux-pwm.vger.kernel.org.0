I suppose dw-apb-timers is the actual document name, but that's already
been used for the timer mode in a number of SoCs so probably isn't going
to be useful. dw-apb-timers-pwm might be a better prefix if snps,pwm is
not going to be acceptable. (Yes, the block can be built as either a
PWM or a generic interrupt generating timer at IP generation time)

As for the version numbers, we could have the -v.vv suffix for these
blocks, but the v2.xx log has 22 entries already and only one feature
for programming (which is also a configurable one so can't be just
enabled by default - it's the 0/100 mode flag in the control registers).

I'm not sure what the v1.xx timers had, but I don't have access to this
information and we're getting these documents as second-generation so I
am not sure if we can get a v1.xx at-all (I suspect this is also going
to have a number of revisions and about 1 useful register api change
which would be the "new mode" double counter method which we currently
rely on having being implicitly enabled by the IP builder (again this
feature is still something that can be configured on IP genaration))

Given the configurability of the core, the version numbers might be
usable at some point, but it does seem to be a lot of churn for what
currently can be described by one boolean for the 0/100 feature that
might-be available. Is there a way of saying the compatible string
can be dw-apb-timers-pwm-2.[0-9][0-9][a-z] ?
