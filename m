Hi Roman,

A while ago others and I have made an attempt at fixing this as well.
Before you continue, I'd like to draw your attention to these previous
attempts. Maybe in the mean time things have changed, maybe they
haven't, but I can definitely tell you that just clearing the enable bit
isn't enough. There is some precise timing involved, hence the delays
are there. Unfortunately to my knowledge, this hasn't been documented
anywhere so it's just trial and error.

Please take a look at this post: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/17/1158

Good luck!

Regards,
Pascal
