I am loathe to speak for Jess, but I don't think either of us are
disagreeing with your patches. I was just trying to understand why it was
wrong in the first place to see if it was intentionally inverted, or if
there was something that could be improve to stop it happening again.
Apologies if that got lost in translation.
