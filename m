Ah I think I get what you mean now about waiting for completion &
reading the bit. I don't know off the top of my head if that bit is
readable. Docs say that they're R/W but I don't know if that means that
an AXI read works or if the value is actually readable. I'll try
something like this if I can.

Yeah, I know. At the end of the day, you're the one familiar with what
PWM consumers expect. If things go the wait-but-maybe-exit-early
direction I think I'll add something to the limitations to cover that.

Cool, will use that so.

I'd be more comfortable with it if the readable registers didn't hold
the old value.

Yeah, I think you did!
