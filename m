All SDAMs being used for lpg have the first few registers (0x40 - 0x44) used by PBS
and also contain register map info and sdam size. For the lpg_chan_nvmem SDAM, after
the first few registers we have all of the per channel data such as LUT_EN,
PATTERN_CONFIG, START_INDEX, and END_INDEX. All of these register addresses
that we write back to are defined at the top of leds-qcom-lpg.c and qcom-pbs.c.

When we have single SDAM PPG, pattern entries begin after all of the per channel data at 0x80.
When we have a second SDAM used for LUT, pattern entries begin after the PBS registers at 0x45.

I just went through all of the code again and lut_sdam_base is really only used twice, so we could
define these register addresses instead of having them in device_data if you think that would
make more sense. Would just need to work on variable name that makes the most sense

#define SDAM_LPG_CHAN_SDAM_LUT_PATTERN_OFFSET 0x80
#define SDAM_LUT_SDAM_LUT_PATTERN_OFFSET 0x45
