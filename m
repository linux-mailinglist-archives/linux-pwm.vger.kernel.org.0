Hello,

this is the set of patches that are open on the list for some time.
Lee suggested to resend them.

@Thierry: I'm unsure what is the best way to nag. Is it really
resending? Or does this just result mostly in overhead because the
patches are still open in patchwork and it adds copies to your mailbox?
(Another downside is that taking the patches from this thread results in
recording a newer Author Date compared to picking up the originals.)

Anhow, you can also find these patches applied on top of a pull of Lee's

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lee/mfd.git ib-mfd-pwm-rtc-v5.13-1

from https://lore.kernel.org/r/20210310110846.GL701493@dell at:

        https://git.pengutronix.de/git/ukl/linux pwm-next

if you prefer to just pull this series.

Best regards
Uwe
