You need dedicated compatible (which will be used by the driver) because
these are two different devices.

No one here argued against introducing new compatible. The question was
why these devices are not compatible with each other? Why new compatible
is not made a part of family of existing compatibles.

I review bindings, so by "devices being made compatible" I meant exactly
what Devicetree specification asks:

"The property value consists of a concatenated list of null terminated
strings, from most specific to most general. They allow a device to
express its compatibility with a family of similar devices, potentially
allowing a single device driver to match against several devices."

Which means that devices share some common characteristics, like
programming model, and differ by some other pieces. For device drivers,
usually this also means that a device can use any of the compatibles to
bind and function properly, within the limits/features of that compatible.

Someone knowing the devices should reorganize compatibles to come up
with family models, e.g. expressed in DT schema like:

oneOf:
 - const: mediatek,mt7986-pwm
 - items:
     - enum:
         - mediatek,mt8183-pwm
     - const: mediatek,mt7986-pwm

and so on.

Example schema expresses it:
