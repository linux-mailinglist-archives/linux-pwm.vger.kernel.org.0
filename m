I did, yeah!

Right, it makes a lot more sense now. Definitely was not clear to me
that that was what you were suggesting.
I'm not sure that disallowing tmp < 255 is something I want to do
though, as this is mainly used as a "soft" IP core in the FPGA fabric,
the clock provided to it may not be particularly high.
Probably not the end of the world though, once added to the limitations.

The implemented period is also going to be quite a ways off with this
method (compared to the method I have been using until now) - although
it is of course far simpler.
You're the PWM expert and are suggesting it, so maybe I should just shut
up and go do it...
