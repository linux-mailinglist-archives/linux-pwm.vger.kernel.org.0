RZ/G2L General PWM Timer (GPT) composed of 8 channels with 32-bit timer
(GPT32E). It supports the following functions
 * 32 bits × 8 channels
 * Up-counting or down-counting (saw waves) or up/down-counting
   (triangle waves) for each counter.
 * Clock sources independently selectable for each channel
 * Two I/O pins per channel
 * Two output compare/input capture registers per channel
 * For the two output compare/input capture registers of each channel,
   four registers are provided as buffer registers and are capable of
   operating as comparison registers when buffering is not in use.
 * In output compare operation, buffer switching can be at crests or
   troughs, enabling the generation of laterally asymmetric PWM waveforms.
 * Registers for setting up frame cycles in each channel (with capability
   for generating interrupts at overflow or underflow)
 * Generation of dead times in PWM operation
 * Synchronous starting, stopping and clearing counters for arbitrary
   channels
 * Starting, stopping, clearing and up/down counters in response to input
   level comparison
 * Starting, clearing, stopping and up/down counters in response to a
   maximum of four external triggers
 * Output pin disable function by dead time error and detected
   short-circuits between output pins
 * A/D converter start triggers can be generated (GPT32E0 to GPT32E3)
 * Enables the noise filter for input capture and external trigger
   operation

This patch series aims to add basic pwm support for RZ/G2L GPT driver
by creating separate logical channels for each IOs.

v8->v9:
 * Added Rb tag from Rob.
 * deassert after devm_clk_get() to avoid reset stays deasserted,in case
   clk_get() fails.
 * Removed ch_offs from struct rzg2l_gpt_chip and use macro instead.
 * Removed clk_disable_unprepare() from probe as it is giving
   gpt_pclk already disabled warning in the error path.
