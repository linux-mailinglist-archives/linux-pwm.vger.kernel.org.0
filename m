Hi, I do intend on finishing this and getting the patches upstream
however I was very short on time for the last while and couldn't get
to it.

For this v2 I see the dt bindings check failure, I think it's the
regex in the core schema that was defined incorrectly but my attempt
to fix it has failed last time I tried it for some reason.
(Now looking at it one more time, I see that '^pwm(@.*|-[0-9a-f])*$'
only allows [a-f] and I just tried to move the * to the correct place)
I also see that I've used the wrong division with rounding macro.

I am planning to send a v3 a bit later with those fixed.

Sorry for delaying the response
Nikita
