Right!

Indeed.

This is right but it complicates a bit the logic as intensity changes
become stateful. If this is what you want, I can do it.

I honestly don't know, the datasheet does not tell anything about it.
If I implement the above logic, glitches will be made less likely.

I could also add more logic to switch the blink state at the 50%
whenever crossing this value but with the above logic added I think it
becomes unreadable and error prone, the risks are not balanced with the
benefits. Of course anyone can enhance the driver in the future.

Ok, I can disable the oscillator in pwm_apply_state() if all
duty_cycles are at 0.

I am not sure to follow you, here are two possible understandings:

1/ state->period > PWM_PERIOD_NS should not be refused, but in the end
get_state should always return PWM_PERIOD_NS.

2/ I should always do the ratio between state->period and
state->duty_cycle as long as state->period >= PWM_PERIOD_NS (In this
case I still don't understand why I should refuse state->period <
PWM_PERIOD_NS).

I have no choice. Actually I don't understand why the core do not
provide the 'last' duty cycle when enabled == false. It provides 0. So
if I don't use the above trick here is what happens:

echo 1 > enabled
echo 50 > duty_cycle
echo 0 > enabled
echo 1 > enabled
* duty_cycle is 0 while I expect it to be 50 *
