RZ/G2L General PWM Timer (GPT) composed of 8 channels with 32-bit timer
(GPT32E). It supports the following functions
 * 32 bits Ã— 8 channels
 * Up-counting or down-counting (saw waves) or up/down-counting
   (triangle waves) for each counter.
 * Clock sources independently selectable for each channel
 * Two I/O pins per channel
 * Two output compare/input capture registers per channel
 * For the two output compare/input capture registers of each channel,
   four registers are provided as buffer registers and are capable of
   operating as comparison registers when buffering is not in use.
 * In output compare operation, buffer switching can be at crests or
   troughs, enabling the generation of laterally asymmetric PWM waveforms.
 * Registers for setting up frame cycles in each channel (with capability
   for generating interrupts at overflow or underflow)
 * Generation of dead times in PWM operation
 * Synchronous starting, stopping and clearing counters for arbitrary
   channels
 * Starting, stopping, clearing and up/down counters in response to input
   level comparison
 * Starting, clearing, stopping and up/down counters in response to a
   maximum of four external triggers
 * Output pin disable function by dead time error and detected
   short-circuits between output pins
 * A/D converter start triggers can be generated (GPT32E0 to GPT32E3)
 * Enables the noise filter for input capture and external trigger
   operation

This patch series aims to add basic pwm support for RZ/G2L GPT driver
by creating separate logical channels for each IOs.

v4->v5:
 * Added Hardware manual details
 * Replaced the comment GTCNT->Counter
 * Removed the macros RZG2L_GPT_IO_PER_CHANNEL and chip.npwm directly
   used in probe.
 * Removed the unsed macro RZG2L_GTPR_MAX_VALUE
 * Added driver prefix for the type name and the variable.
 * Initialization of per_channel data moved from request->probe.
 * Updated clr parameter for rzg2l_gpt_modify for Start count.
 * Started using mutex and usage_count for handling shared
   period and prescalar for the 2 channels.
 * Updated the comment cycle->period.
 * Removed clk_disable from rzg2l_gpt_reset_assert_pm_disable()
 * Replaced pc->rzg2l_gpt.
 * Updated prescale calculation.
 * Moved pm_runtime_{get_sync,put} from {request,free}->{enable,disable}
 * Removed platform_set_drvdata as it is unused
 * Removed the variable pwm_enabled_by_bootloader 
 * Added dev_err_probe in various probe error path.
 * Added an error message, if devm_pwmchip_add fails.
v3->v4:
 * Changed the local variable type i from u16->u8 and prescaled_period_
   cycles from u64->u32 in calculate_prescale().
 * Replaced mul_u64_u64_div_u64()->mul_u64_u32_div()
 * Dropped the comma after the sentinel.
 * Add a variable to track pwm enabled by bootloader and added comments
   in probe().
 * Removed unnecessary rzg2l_gpt_reset_assert_pm_disable() from probe.
 * Replaced devm_clk_get()->devm_clk_get_prepared()
 * Removed devm_clk_get_optional_enabled()
v2->v3:
 * Added Rb tag from Rob for the bindings.
 * Updated limitation section
 * Added prefix "RZG2L_" for all macros
 * Modified prescale calculation
 * Removed pwm_set_chip_data
 * Updated comment related to modifying Mode and Prescaler
 * Updated setting of prescale value in rzg2l_gpt_config()
 * Removed else branch from rzg2l_gpt_get_state()
 * removed the err label from rzg2l_gpt_apply()
 * Added devm_clk_get_optional_enabled() to retain clk on status,
   in case bootloader turns on the clk of pwm.
 * Replaced devm_reset_control_get_exclusive->devm_reset_control_get_shared
   as single reset shared between 8 channels.
V1->v2:
 * Added '|' after 'description:' to preserve formatting.
 * Removed description for pwm_cells as it is common property.
 * Changed the reg size in example from 0xa4->0x100
 * Added Rb tag from Geert for bindings.
 * Added Limitations section
 * dropped "_MASK" from the define names.
 * used named initializer for struct phase
 * Added gpt_pwm_device into a flexible array member in rzg2l_gpt_chip
 * Revised the logic for prescale
 * Added .get_state callback
 * Improved error handling in rzg2l_gpt_apply
 * Removed .remove callback
 * Tested the driver with PWM_DEBUG enabled.

RFC->v1:
 * Added Description in binding patch
 * Removed comments from reg and clock
 * replaced rzg2l_gpt_write_mask()->rzg2l_gpt_modify()
 * Added rzg2l_gpt_read() and updated macros
 * Removed dtsi patches, will send it separately
