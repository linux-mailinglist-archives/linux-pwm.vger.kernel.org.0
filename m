Full ack, I considered asking for that, but after some time I was in the
"I reviewed the patch today"-mode (which is quite similar to the mode
you described :-) and forgot. (Even in that mode the PREG_TO_VAL macro
annoyed me a bit.)

I think it's sensible to only talk about either the register values or
the factors. I tend to think that talking about the register values is
easier at the end and recommend not to hide the +1 (or -1) in a macro.

Having said that here are my results of thinking a bit about how to
choose register values:

Let r(p) denote the period that is actually configured if p is
requested.

The nice properties we want (i.e. those a consumer might expect?) are:

 a) =E2=88=80p: r(p) =E2=89=A4 p
    i.e. never configure a bigger period than requested
    (This is a bit arbitrary, but nice to get a consistent behaviour for
    all drivers and easier to handle than requesting the nearest
    possible period.)

 b) =E2=88=80p, q: p =E2=89=A4 q =E2=9F=B9 r(p) =E2=89=A4 r(q)
    i.e. monotonicity

 c) =E2=88=80p: r(roundup(r(p))) =3D r(p)
    i.e. idempotency

 d) =E2=88=80p, q: r(p) =E2=89=A4 q =E2=9F=B9 r(p) =E2=89=A4 r(q)
    i.e. pick the biggest possible period

(Sidenote: d) and a) imply b) and c))

If you always set period_steps to 0xfe
(in Python syntax:

	tmp =3D p * clkrate // NSPS
	period_steps =3D 0xfe
	prescale =3D tmp // (period_steps + 1) - 1

) you get this consistent behaviour.

This has the upside of being easy to implement and cheap to run.
Downside is that it's coarse and fails to implement periods that would
require e.g prescale =3D 0 and period_steps < 0xfe. As period_steps is
big, the domain to chose the duty cycle from is good.

If you pick period_steps and prescale such that
	(period_steps + 1) * (prescale + 1)
is the maximal value that makes r(p) =E2=89=A4 p you have an increased runt=
ime
because you have to test multiple values for period_steps. I don't think
there is an algorithm without a loop to determine an optimal pair?!
Usually this gives a better match that the easy algorithm above for the
period, but the domain for duty_cycle is (usually) smaller.
I think we have a) and d) here, so that's good.

I think for most consumers a big domain for duty_cycle is more important
that a good match for the requested period. So I tend to recommend the
easy algorithm, but I'm not religious about that and open for other
opinion and reasoning.

Then I think I got that wrong in the same way.  Should this be better
described in a comment then? (I didn't recheck, maybe there is a good
description already?)

Uwe
