The problem here is not the impossibility to do the things. The problem is
that things are done and validated on a Windows system. After that it close
to impossible to update the firmware or perform any architectural changes.

OTOH, announcing the separate device out of the existing MMIO space doesn't
sound right from the software point of view that should follow the hardware
representation.

Ideally, this should be an adaptive MFD-like device, but it makes things
even more complicated than has been discussed already. (Note, that some
of the pin control drivers are enumerated as platform devices, and that
code should also be taken into account)
