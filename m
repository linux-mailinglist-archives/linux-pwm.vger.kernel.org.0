Hi Uwe,

Thanks for taking the time to review this patch. I have a few comment
below.

I take this to refer also to the defines below, right?

Actually for pre_div and pwm_div the caller passes int values. I agree
this is inconsistent.

probe sets this clock to the fixed 100MHz rate (CLK_SRC_FREQ). Would you
prefer to derive MIN_PERIOD_NS from CLK_SRC_FREQ?

The thing is that we have two dividers to play with. I can't think of a
cleaner way to find the best match for a given target frequency.
