hi Alex & Uwe,

Thanks for the advices and clarifications.

Some of drivers in driver/pwn use pwm->state.enabled directly in their 
apply and others name it "enabled", see pwm-tiecap.c, pwm-berlin.c, 
pwm-vt8500.c and pwm-stm32.c.

I prefer keeping consist with those drivers, "disabled" confuses me.
