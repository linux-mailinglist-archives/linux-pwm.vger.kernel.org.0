It means 'write 0 to PWM_CK_26M_SEL to make sure PWM BCLK is selected'.
If the register isn't used at all on MT7986 (despite being mentioned in
the datasheet) or the value written there never has any effect then
there is no need to do this and has_ck_26m_sel can be false.

Maybe something else already sets the PWM_CK_26M_SEL register to 0
before Linux starts (e.g. U-Boot)?
