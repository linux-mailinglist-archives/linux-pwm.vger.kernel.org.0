Pros of of_match_ptr() / ACPI_PTR():
- saves a few dozens of bytes in the module ID tables
- doesn't show ACPI ID for non-ACPI platform or OF ID on non-OF platforms

Cons:
- prevents from using OF IDs on ACPI platforms
- doesn't show ACPI ID for non-ACPI platform or OF ID on non-OF platforms
- makes error prone for the compiler to have the variable unused
- makes code uglier

(I left the second in the both because I find useful to have all supported IDs
 to be listed even if the system is compiled with OF/ACPI opted-out.)

Personally I remove the of_match_ptr()/ACPI_PTR() from drivers that can be used
on OF or ACPI platforms, which leaves us only with the drivers we are 100% sure
that they won't ever be used on non-OF platforms. BUT, I do not see any sense
to have of_match_ptr() that either in use, because the driver in question is
100% for OF platform, or not when it's compile tested, which means it reduces
test coverage anyway. All the same for ACPI_PTR().

TL;DR: I don't see any [big] usefulness of keeping those macros.
