Sure, ok. I guess the pwm-ir-tx driver is less broken in that regard.

In that case I propose we merge the ir-rx51 for the next merge window,
and further fixes to pwm-ir-tx go in when they're ready.

It's not perfect, but the assumption is that those times are going to be
the same or very similar for each tx. So, if the setup/warmup time is the same
and if there is no complete delay, then using usleep() between two txs 
works fine. I think in reality the setup/complete times are extremely
short (time to send usb packet or so), and compared to IR timings this is
insignificant.

Having said that, maybe a different scheme would be nice, which could offer
better precision.

Two problems:

It's a breaking uapi change: for example lircd and ir-ctl use this for 
calculating the gap between transmits. If we start returning early then
things break.

Secondly, not all drivers can support this, or they would need to support
it using a thread or so, which makes the driver code much more complicated
and we'd have to change nearly every driver.
