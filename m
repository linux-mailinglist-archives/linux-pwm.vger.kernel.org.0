Hi Uwe,

Thanks for your review comments.

I'll post a patch for that.

I guess that this is because 0 period does not make sense for pwm. It is
like a zero divisor. What is the common behavior?

I'll post a patch for that as well.

Not sure what was the original intention. Maybe Andrew can explain.

On my hardware (Armada 8040), zero 'on' value does not work as
expected. There is a blink once in a long while. Maybe this is the
reason?

As I understand, all these issues should not block this patch, right?

BTW, the key you used to sign your message is expired since 2020-01-10
on the key server I use (keys.gnupg.net). Where can I find your updated
key?

Thanks,
