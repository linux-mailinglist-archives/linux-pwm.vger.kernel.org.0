Hi Andy,

Thanks for the feedback.

I understand your concern but I am not sure to understand which
solution you have in mind. In the former case, could you explain a bit
more what you are thinking about? Would linking the PWM support with
the GPIO driver (code would be located in another .c file) work for
you? Or maybe you would prefer an MFD on top of the GPIO driver?

As for the later case, I am not willing to re-implement GPIO support in
an alternate driver for an already supported chip, it is too much work
for the time I can spend on it.


Thanks,
