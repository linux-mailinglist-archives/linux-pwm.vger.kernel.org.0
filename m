Then ask Thierry and Uwe, what would you want to have happen if you were
the maintainer of a subsystem?

Not noise, just confusion on my part.  I'm glad to take patches that
have no obvious maintainers, or maintainers that have disappeared, but
that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Also remember that we had the merge window, which is 2 weeks of us not
being able to take any new code at all, even for fixes.

And finally, to make it easier for your code to be accepted, please take
the time to review other's code for the subsystems you care about to
make the maintainer's load easier.  If you do that, you will often find
your patches getting faster response just by virtue of there being less
work to do on the subsystem overall.  Why not do that right now to help
out with other PWM patches?

thanks,
