Hi Uwe,

Thanks for the quick reply.

Yes, in fact, my first approach (that I didn't send) was only storing enabled
and duty cycle. For some reason I ended storing the full pwm_state struct, but I
guess is not really needed.

The consumer is the pwm_bl driver. Actually I'n trying to identify other consumers.

Yes that's the sequence.

pwm_bl is compliant with this, the problem in the pwm-cros-ec driver is when you
set the duty_cycle but enable is 0.

Good question, I don't really know all consumer requirements, but AFAIK, usually
when you want to program duty_cycle to 0 you also want to disable the PWM. At
least for the backlight case doesn't make sense program first the duty_cycle and
then enable the PWM, is implicit, if duty_cycle is 0 the PWM is disabled, if
duty_cycle > 0 the PWM is enabled.

Sorry, when you say pwm_get_state(), you mean the core call or the lowlevel
driver call?

Nice catch, thanks, I'll send a patch to fix this.
