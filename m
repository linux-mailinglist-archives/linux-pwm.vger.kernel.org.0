Hi Uwe,

Thanks again for your detailed review.

I have a few comments and questions below.

I have no idea. I guess not. I'll drop this macro in v6.

Quick 'git grep' indicates that '[[:digit:]]\+MHz' is a little more
popular than '[[:digit:]]\+ MHz' in kernel code. But OK, not a big deal.

The code only uses this for period validity check. It saves us some code
for run-time division.

I guess so. I have no access to hardware documentation, mind you. I
first tried to do only one write to REG1, but it had no effect. The
existence of the UPDATE bit also indicates that hardware works as you
suggest.

No idea.

Yes. That's what experimentation here shows. The pin is pulled up, but
the PWM keeps it low.

As I said above, this is meant to save code for the less critical
case. Should I use clk_get_rate() here as well? If we go with
assigned-clock-rates, as you suggest below, we'll have to do that
anyway.

That is my understanding of the code intent.

Looks better.

That is, calculate the minimum pre_div value for which the division
above always produces pwm_div in range, right?

What is "100% relative duty"? How does pwm_div clamping helps?

I'll do that in v6. That's what Bjorn originally suggested in response
to v2.

That's 'assigned-clock-rates' I believe. I'll try that.
