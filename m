Correct.

I assume the period ticking over as we are updating the values is your
concern here. I'm not sure that there's all that much we can do about
that, so I guess I shall update the comment.
Perhaps writing out period_steps and prescale should be done after
computing the new duty cycle to reduce the possible window since that
may require an expensive division on a 32-bit arch?

Yes. Although, I did some poking around with it just now & that actually
only happens if prescale is also 0.
If it is non-zero, get to see some other "interesting behaviour" where
the period becomes gigantic - for example @ prescale =3D 0x3, the period
becomes about a quarter of a second w/ a 50% duty cycle. clk_rate is
62.5 MHz. I'd need to dig out the RTL to justify that one!

I've just gone and made apply() return -EINVAL for this, which the
subsystem does for requests of zero periods.

Yeah, I read this back to myself before sending v15 & thought that it
didn't need to be changed. I think removing the first line should go.

Hah, no. This IP is about as old as I am & appears to have been written
with keeping the FPGA utilisation % to a minimum. No such luxuries!

Unless this is a different fear of racing, see above.

=2E..so in your prime case above, we would initially compute a prescale
value that is too large, and then wind up hitting the test of the
remainder here, thereby realising that the smaller prescale value is a
better fit?
Perhaps that's not an acceptable way to handle the issue though.

Because 513 > 511 & 254 > 170!
Is the aim not to produce a period that is less than or equal to that
requested? The aim of this driver is to pick a prescale/period_steps
combo that satisfies that constraint, while also trying to maximise the
"finegrainness" of the duty cycle.
The latter should be stated in a comment above.

It should trigger for any value 255 * n < x < 256 * n, no?
Say for tmp of 767:
*prescale =3D DIV64_U64_ROUND_UP(767, 254 + 1) - 1 =3D DIV64_U64_ROUND_UP(3=
=2E00784...) - 1 =3D 3
remainder =3D 0.00784.. * (254 + 1) =3D 2

Am I going nuts? Wouldn't be the first time that I've made a hames of
things here, there are 16 versions for a reason after all.

Conor.
