I see the "enabled" flag is used in a way that I didn't
notice before.  Changing its name to "disabled" (to mean
"we have disabled the device within this function already")
would allow it to be used in the same way, but would make
it more obvious it's not just a copy of "old" device state.

Thanks for clarifying that.  I did not know what was expected.

Now I see, yes, the local variable gets changed when the
disable occurred above.

I don't actually see anything that sets usage_power to true,
although "pwm-pca9685.c" tests its value.

I guess it's an advisory parameter that's passed to the apply
callback function.  It's described as optional, but--not being
a "PWM person"--this isn't obvious to me.  Maybe the comments
describing the field or the apply callback could define the
semantics a little better at some point.
