Happy to help. :-)

I am not objecting about scaling the voltage through a regulator,
that's fine to me. However, encoding a power domain as a regulator
(even if it may seem like a regulator) isn't. Well, unless Mark Brown
has changed his mind about this.

In this case, it seems like the regulator supply belongs in the
description of the power domain provider.

I guess I haven't paid enough attention how power domain regulators
are being described then. I was under the impression that the CPUfreq
case was a bit specific - and we had legacy bindings to stick with.

Can you point me to some other existing examples of where power domain
regulators are specified as a regulator in each device's node?

Kind regards
