Hello,

Are you dealing with a large number of scattered machines on the factory =
floor, all involved in the production process of a single product?

In such a situation, centralizing control of all devices from one locatio=
n provides convenience to operators, as well as the ability to visualize =
operations across the entire enterprise and plan production more efficien=
tly.

We offer a tool that enables continuous process monitoring, analysis of p=
roduction progress, and implementation of improvements, allowing for quic=
k identification of losses and their causes.

Key performance indicators, such as OEE, TPT, TEEP, MTBR, MTBF, are autom=
atically calculated, and all data is reported to other systems such as ER=
P, MES, and so on.

Would you be open to discussing the utilization of such a tool in your co=
mpany?


Best regards
Kurt Birky
