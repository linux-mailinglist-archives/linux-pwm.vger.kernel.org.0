Read entire message, not some parts of it.

"Subject: drop second, redundant "bindings".
Also use proper PATCH prefix."

Where did you drop the bindings in the subject? I still see it, look:
"dt-bindings: mfd: Add aspeed pwm-tach binding"
                                       ^^^^^^^^ what is this?

I still see them, so how did you solve them?

You do not need children for this.

Your example DTS must be complete and nothing like this was there. There
is still no point in the children.

You are joking right? The dependency is clearly visible in the driver.
You are getting parent's node to get its resources. That's the
dependency which is not allowed. Children should take care of their
resources, not parent's!

> In fact, it doesn’t require a specific driver to bind with the "aspeed,ast2600-pwm-tach" label. Their purpose is solely to share the same clock, reset phandle and base address.

That's what the drivers are for, so you need it...

> The main reason for using simple-mfd in this case is because these two independent devices share the same base address. In fact, I can relocate the clock and reset configurations to the child nodes rather than the parent node.

How? These are clocks of parent. Don't create fake DTS to represent
workarounds. Or you want to say that current DTS is fake and does not
match the hardware?

>  In this case, I still can't use simple-mfd?

For the last time: No. You cannot, because you have resources needed for
children.

Krzysztof
