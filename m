I think the approach would be right. Some potential issues I see:
- Then we would have three pwm bindings:
  1. We have to keep the current binding in order not to break
     potential non-Linux DT users.
  2. The new binding, what you call v2.
  3. The binding for the new chip versions with core pwm clock.

For the v2 binding I'm not sure how to handle the following.
Board DTS files have:

&pwm_ab {
        pinctrl-0 = <&pwm_a_e_pins>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        clocks = <&xtal>;
        clock-names = "clkin0";
        status = "okay";
};

Means if we describe the mux parent clocks in the parent platform
dtsi, then we would overwrite the clocks property here and lose
the information (at least that's my understanding).

I'm not sure its worth the effort considering that we talk about
a legacy pwm block.
