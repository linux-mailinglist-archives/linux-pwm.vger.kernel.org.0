Hey Nylon,

Please run scripts/get_maintainer.pl before sending patches, you missed
both me & the PWM maintainers unfortunately!
AFAIK, the PWM maintainers use patchwork, so you will probably have to
resend this patchset so that it is on their radar.
I've marked the series as "Changes Requested" on the RISC-V one.

Please delete link 2, convert the other two to standard Link: tags and
put this information in the dts patch. Possibly into the PWM patch too,
depending on what the PWM maintainers think.
This info should be in the commit history IMO and the commit message for
the dts patch says what's obvious from the diff without any explanation
as to why.

I did a bit of looking around on lore, to see if I could figure out
why it was done like this in the first place, and I found:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pwm/CAJ2_jOG2M03aLBgUOgGjWH9CUxq2aTG97eSX70=
=3DUaSbGCMMF_g@mail.gmail.com/

That doesn't explain the driver, but it does explain the dts being that
way. Perhaps a Fixes tag is also in order? But only if both patches get
one, otherwise backporting would lead to breakage.

The min() construct appears to have been there since the RFC driver was
first posted.

Thanks,
Conor.
