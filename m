Thanks, this fixed the remaining complaints. Did it exactly as you

Default and also maximum timeout is 256ms. My hardware is configured to
let the device stay in reset until the driver puts it out of reset by
setting the associated GPIO. Datasheet refers to it as "Disable mode".
Outputs are turned off.
Without having such reset logic, the device would need to have the
watchdog disabled in the bootloader and continue in "Normal mode" or it
would go into "Safe mode" while booting the kernel almost sure violating
the timeout. Outputs are then controlled by the INx input logic signals.
I think there is no single solution but rather depends on the use case.
There are three modes which the device can be in when the driver is probed:
"Disable", "Safe" and "Normal". All three are handled by this driver,
assuming the watchdog should be disabled.

I will leave a comment, but I'm not sure if I can come up with a good
solution since the maximum timeout is very low with 256ms. For interaction
with userspace it must be at least 1s.
Why is the handling of the watchdog conceptually wrong here, I could use
devm_watchdog_register_device to register it, why can't I just disable it
here ?

I don't thinks so, the watchdog and the outputs belong somehow together.
When the device runs into an timeout it switches into "Safe" mode and the
outputs are controlled by the INx input logic signals.
I thought of a mfd device as a device which provides multiple functions
not really belonging together. Didn't find a clear definition. What do you
think of it ?

Best regards
Dimitri
