that means your calls to wait_for_completion() / complete() do not 
match. I think you should check why.

not really, you can have pwm_state * pwm_ir member and pass pointer to 
the stack variable.

Who will enable pwm if not in tx? Like, doesn't the driver have 
exclusive ownership of the pwm? Also, every transmission ends up wit pwm 
disabled, so disabling it once again does not make sense to me.

Why is that? Edge start is controlled by the calls in timer function, it 
should not matter when it is called for the first time.

see my previous comment re struct var. Also, look at the overhead: 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6-rc3/source/include/linux/pwm.h#L349 
- you call pwm_get_state() for every edge.

Yes, and I stated that couple of times in my previous emails :)

Sure, and I have a patch for n900 that does this, however, for your i2c 
case there is no solution. Also, we may play smart and dynamically 
decrease sleep time (by adjusting edge by lets say 5-10 us every pulse 
until we have some sane value) if we see it is too long. No strong 
preferences here, it is just that I have code that works.
