This is something that we don't agree about. IMHO it's better if
consumers specify the state they want to apply completely themselves
without using pwm_get_state(). I'm convinced that many people don't
understand pwm_get_state() and the resulting corner cases.

One such corner case is the one we hit here, that pwm_get_state() can
return a state that cannot be reapplied. Another common misunderstanding
is that (apart from directly after driver init (or was it after each
request?)) pwm_get_state() isn't about the actual HW state, but about
the state that was last applied successfully.

Do you think that I should be able to do:

	pwm_apply(mypwm, &(struct pwm_state){ .period =3D 0, .duty_cycle =3D 0, .e=
nabled =3D false, .polarity =3D PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL });

? This should be enough for a driver to know what to do. After that,
what is the "reasonable" thing that should happen if I follow up with

 	pwm_get_state(pwm, &state);
 	state.enabled =3D true;
 	pwm_apply_state(pwm, &state);

?

The current state is that the first pwm_apply() fails. I didn't check,
but I can imagine that there are other combinations of (state, lowlevel
driver) where pwm_apply() succeeds with .enabled =3D false but not with
=2Eenabled =3D true. (For example consider a driver that can only do
inversed polarity, or polarity > 100000. What should happen when I call

	pwm_apply(mypwm, &(struct pwm_state){ .period =3D 100, .duty_cycle =3D 20,=
 .enabled =3D false, .polarity =3D PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL });

?)

If I was to design a PWM API today, I'd consider to not put .enabled
into pwm_state. With that enabled =3D true would be implied for
pwm_apply_state(), and there would be a separate pwm_disable().

Best regards
Uwe
