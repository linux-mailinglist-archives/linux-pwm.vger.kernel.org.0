Hi Uwe,

Thanks for your review comments.

I don't know. PWM does not work when this bit is not set here. The
original downstream driver[1] does not set this bit on disable. But it
also enables PWM unconditionally on .config. I added the 'enabled' check
in .config, and then PWM stopped working even when enabled later. It was
only by accident (excess copy/paste) that I found this workaround.

A comment on the original code says that PWM_UPDATE is "auto cleared".
This is evidently not true on my hardware (IPQ6010). This might be true
for older variants of this PWM block. Unfortunately, I have no access to
hardware documentation.
