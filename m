Perhaps we should clarify the single delta_t by requiring all those
delta_t to be the same, rather than ignoring their value.

I.e. we make the ping-pong pattern:

<value> <lopause+t> ... <value[N/2-1]> <t> <value[N/2]> <hipause+t> <value[N/2-1]> <t> ... <value> <t>

And for non-ping-pong:

<value> <lopause+t> <value> <t> ... <value> <t> <value> <hipause + t>


What do you think?

There's a comment in lpg_pattern_set() where I tried to capture this.

I don't think it's worth documenting the behavior/structure away from
the driver. But let's make sure it's captured properly there.
