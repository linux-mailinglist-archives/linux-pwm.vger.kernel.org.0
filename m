Did you consider format C1 instead?

To my understanding, the C formats are paletted, which would also fit
very nicely semantically. You have an enumerated list of pixel values
and each of them produces some arbitrary color on screen. This would
fit e.g. blue/white LCD panels nicely.

The little problem there is the palette.

C8 format is traditionally translated to RGB triplets through GAMMA LUT.
Therefore the display itself is still three-channel, it's just the
framebuffer format that is single-channel. But now, we are dealing
with truly paletted displays. Furthermore, the palette is fixed,
ingrained in the panel hardware.

So we would probably need a new KMS property for the fixed palette of
the panel. What would it be called? Would it be a connector property?

The property would be a read-only blob, an array that maps Cx values to
"colors". How do we represent "colors"? How do we accommodate C1, C2,
C4 and C8 with the same blob?

Since the blob is a mapping from color index to "color", and the array
in the blob has N entries, we could simply say that Cx integer value is
the color index. If the Cx you use does not go up to N, then you miss
some colors. If the Cx you use can go higher than N, then Cx values >=3D
N will clamp to N-1, for example. Of course, if your panel palette has
only 4 entries, you can expose C1 and C2 and have no reason to expose
C4 or C8, avoiding the Cx >=3D N issue.

How do we define the array contents then, the "colors"... plain old RGB
triplets do not mean much[1], but that would be better than nothing. I
also suppose that people would not be keen on seeing something like CIE
1931 XYZ or Lab values, even though those would probably have the most
useful definition. Coming up with those values properly would require a
colorimeter. As a compromise, maybe we could use an RGB triplet, and
assume sRGB SDR color space and transfer function, just like we do with
all displays whether they are that or not. If someone needs to know
better, then they can profile the display. sRGB triplets would likely
give enough intuition to what color the indices result in, that it
could be used in automated color conversions or quantizations from
larger color spaces like sRGB with some rough degree of color
similarity.

It is a lot of hassle, but it would have a clear benefit: userspace
would know very well how the display behaves (what colors it shows,
roughly), and you could use Cx formats to drive a panel in its "native"
format.

Possible problems are around interactions with the old GAMMA property,
which is traditionally used for the C8 palette. But if you have a
fixed-palette panel, then maybe you wouldn't expose GAMMA property on
the CRTC at all?

I have no idea how this would map to fbdev API though.
