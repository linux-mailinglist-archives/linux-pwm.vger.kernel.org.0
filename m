Yes, I think we should have default limits.

Unless we go as far as a schema for every specific fan model, then there 
is actually no way we can have specific limits unless the fan 
controllers have some limits.

The most I see in tree for pulses-per-revolution is 2. There's no value 
in more. So set the max to 4 and then if anyone needs more they can bump 
the value.

Or maybe there's some electrical/mechanical design reason fans are 1 or 
2 pulses and we'll never see anything else? This document[1] seems to 
indicate that is indeed the case. (First hit googling "fan tach signal 
pulses")

That sounds like a property of the controller, not the fan, so it 
belongs in the controller binding. Is this really a common thing?

Correct.

I tend to think that should be implied from the parent node and/or other 
properties. PWM if "pwms" property is present. DC if the supply is 
variable. We could also use compatible strings in the fan nodes if 
there's a need.

That reminds me, both of these modes probably need a table of 
voltage/duty-cycle to RPMs. I imagine it's not always a linear response.  
Naresh also privately sent me (don't do that) an updated common binding 
which we discussed the need for this. I expect him to comment further 
with details.

Perhaps uint8-array to align with existing versions of the property.

Yes, but when we have N child nodes of the same thing, we usually have 
"reg" and its value corresponds to how the parent identifies each child. 
We already have a mixture using PWM or tach channel. Yes, this can all 
just be in the fan controllers binding, but putting it here would just 
document the options.
