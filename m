Is this some material for the commit log to motivate the design
decision?

ok.

I didn't try to understand the pattern part. I know that for PWMs there
is no pattern support, wasn't aware it's a thing for LEDs.

Anyhow, not a hard requirement to split from my side.

Please add this to the Limitations section. It's not actually a
limitation, but still this is a good place to put this information.

Can you test that? It's as easy as configuring a long period with 0%
relative duty cycle and then immediately a 100% relative duty cycle.

Yes. At least I only found lpg_calc_freq() assigning chan->period and
chan->enabled. And unless I missed something this isn't called before
the pwm core calls .get_state().
