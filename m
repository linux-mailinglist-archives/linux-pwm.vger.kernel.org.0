You also introduce the abbreviation PBS in the driver, I think it would
be useful to mention what that is as well.

It would also be preferred if you expanded (some of) these abbreviations
in this description, to make the TLA-soup taste better.

Looking at its usage, it doesn't feel so much "is PPG enabled" as "does
this instance use PPG", it's not a thing that can be enabled/disabled in
runtime.

So "has_ppg" seems like a better name, or perhaps even "use_sdam" and
avoid "PPG" completely and make it clearer to the average reader?

I can't think of a reason for this to ever be negative, so please mark
it unsigned.

(It seems to have been an oversight to make this num_channels signed,
when the two other instances are unsigned. But that's an unrelated
change)

Suggestion. It's idiomatic to deal with the error path first in the
kernel, so writing this as "if it's an error propagate that, otherwise
return 0" would feel more natural. It would have also saved me from
wondering if you consider 0 to be an error or not.

It seems I choose to sprinkle the bit defines throughout the driver, but
all other register definitions are gathered at the top of the file. So
please put this one there as well (and keep the PBS_SW_TRIG_BIT here).

Forgive me if I'm confused, but doesn't this mean that if I configure a
pattern and then set the brightness twice the pattern will be disabled
again?

Perhaps cleaner to just call lpg_sdam_apply_lut_control() directly from
lpg_apply() instead of bouncing in this function?

This changes the divisor for the non-ppg case from LPG_RESOLUTION_9BIT
- 1 to LPG_RESOLUTION_9BIT.

Please perform any modifications to the non-ppg behavior in a separate
commit, so that any potential regression can be easily identified as
coming from refactoring, intentional changes or the introduction of new
the new support.

return dev_err_probe(lpg->dev, "PTR_ERR(lpg->lpg_chan_nvmem, "Failed
to...") will handle the EPROBE_DEFER conditioning and make the error
message show up in /sys/kernel/debug/devices_deferred after boot.

Same here.

rc is 0 here. return 0 would make that obvious to the reader, and save
you from having to zero-initialize the variable.

This is effectively checking if the previous function also bailed.
Perhaps it would be cleaner to just string these two together?

I'm failing to see the usefulness of this change.
