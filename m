I don't understand that one.

that is 0? Do you mean "input period"? If so, better refuse the request.

I wouldn't state this, too trivial. Instead the following are
interesting:

 - The driver doesn't implement the right rounding rules
 - The driver needs updating to the atomic API

That pr_warn is a bad idea as it spams the kernel log when the
configuration is changed frequently. Wouldn't it be easier to calculate
the frequency that is needed to achieve period_ns and check that against
max_frequency?

required_clk_rate could be defined here, which is better as it narrows
its scope.

I don't understand the part with the round-up mechanism.

What happens if clk_set_rate configures a higher rate than requested?

With my suggestion above, you can drop the min_period_ns field.
