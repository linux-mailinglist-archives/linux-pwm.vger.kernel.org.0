Hi,

Thanks for the review!

Having three discrete checks for three possible outcomes is a bit
easier for me to understand, but I have no preference and can change
it to your version.

Will add the latter.

Will do. I'm not sure if the underlying clock drivers guarantee the
chosen rate to be rounded in line with that however, e.g. qcom SoC
clocks that I target use lookup tables to find the closest rate
with known M/N config values and set that. (So unless one makes sure
the table has all the required rates, period is not guaranteed.)

This is not an issue for my use cases though: Don't think any
of the led or haptic motor controllers I've seen in my devices
need a perfect rate.

I think this is another line into the "Limitations" description
that was suggested later.

Will move clk_enable() as the last action. After that it makes more
sense to "squash" two leftover checks for disabled state so will do
that as well.

... Except moving it caused a nice big WARNING from my clock controller...

(Which doesn't stop it from working afaict, but very much undesirable
for me.)
Unsure if this is something common or just a quirk of this specific
driver but I'd rather take a little glitch on the output than
make clock driver unhappy knowing how picky this hardware sometimes is...

Will add the description with limitations.

Will change the order. Also adding an clk_disable() there for cases
when it's still enabled.

Oops, existence of "pwm-clock" (clk-pwm.c) and my attempts to not
collide with it's naming causes quite a bit of weird mix-up's like this.
.name should be "pwm-clk" in line with the driver filename and
all the method prefixes there but compatible should still be "clk-pwm"
so it's not as similar with an opposite "pwm-clock" compatible.

Will use the more common one then.

I will send a v2 with those changes (as well as with a filename fix
for the DT bindings) a bit later.
