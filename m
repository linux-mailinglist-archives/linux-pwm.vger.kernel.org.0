The issue with hrtimers is that we cannot use them directly, as 
pwm_apply_state() may sleep, but hrtimer function is called in atomic 
context.

I made some POC here, but unfortunately it failed more or less. The idea 
of POC is: setup hrtimer, start it in pwm_ir_tx() and do 
wait_for_completion() in a loop while calling complete() for the timer 
function. While it improves things a bit, I wouldn't say it makes the 
driver working ok on n900 - my TV registers one of let's say 5-10 pulse 
packages.

We have couple of issues:

- scheduler seems to use 32kHz timer, which means that we can never have 
precise pulse width, with error up to ~30 us, no matter what we do, IIUC.

- wait_for_completion() suffers from the same latency issue that 
usleep_range() has - it exits after 300-400 us after complete() has been 
called in the timer function.

- turning pwm off needs ~300us, because of either omap_dm_timer_stop() 
calling clk_get_rate() or __omap_dm_timer_stop() waiting for fclk period 
* 3.5 (see 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6-rc3/source/drivers/clocksource/timer-ti-dm.c#L269)

- in order to achieve some sane latency distribution, I have to 
set_user_nice(current, MIN_NICE); in pwm_ir_tx()

ir-rx51 has conceptual problem of calling function that might sleep from 
atomic context, however, we can fix omap_dm_timer_stop() to not call 
clk_get_rate() and that would make it working. So yeah, if we can't fix 
pwm-ir-tx then patches removal along with fixing dmtimer and fixing a 
couple of code issues ir-rx51 has, seems the only option to have working 
IRTX on n900. Maybe we can rename it to pwm-ir-tx-hrtimer as there is 
nothing n900 specific in it.

The only thing I didn't try yet is to start another thread and to set 
that thread to use FIFO scheduler. I will report once I have tried that.
