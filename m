I have no devices in my hand to get it tested, but i think it's 
reasonable to turn off PWM before switching off its polarity.

What's more, it follows the implementation of pwm_apply_legacy, which is 
the way how it works now.

will do.

Not clear about gb_pwm_config_operation rounds.
For get_state, i will look into it.
