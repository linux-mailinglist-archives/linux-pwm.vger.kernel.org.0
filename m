How unintuitive and unfortunate. I wonder if there is an upside of this
approach that I'm missing.

I always like to understand the hardware, can you explain the problems
in more details?

An exact value would be interesting, then when I spot a rounding problem
I could give you a test case to double check.

I'm surprise, I would have expected that my test recipe would find such
an issue. Could you follow my arguing about the rounding direction?
There always the possibility that I'm wrong, too.
